You know that what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can dress it like an agriculture, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and schools.
And you know that a space usually is something that you have somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a speculation.
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bonicas did.
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the '60s in the middle school, in Steven, Ohio.
By the way they hit it until every week on the children's bathroom, until a teacher saved me life.
She saved my life when I was allowed to get into the teacher's room.
I did it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the '90s, I felt the need to start working on organizations that fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I received a phone call of that teacher, the Post Post he said, "I need to see you.
I am destroyed that of adults we never get to know.
You could come to Ohio and please bring that guy who I know you've ever found.
And I have to tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to do this please.
Okay, the next day we were in Club.
We went to see, we laugh, we cry, and we realized that she needed to be hospital.
We found it a place, we interviewed it, and we take care of their family, because it was necessary.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to know as an adult came to me, he became a breakthrough box and he was placed in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed up, had become a circle -- and that explanation that I talked about was made in itself.
The choice is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I jumped out of her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
I need truth and beauty, and I'm very happy to talk about this.
I also need -- needs dignity, love and pleasure -- and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first tips.
I was astonishing.
My heart dropped fast, I was married, trying to understand what I was in front of me.
The trials around me are around the water around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't think that it was a snow of snow on another tail of snow year after year.
The therapies are born when they get rid of the glaciers or they break the ice walls.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are refuse to bring up and pull up to the end, while others can't withstand them more and they go into a dramatic passion arm.
It's easy to think, by looking at a toy, that they're isolated separate and alone, in large measure as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As a trick department, I'm breathing your ancestral atmosphere.
As a little bit of a trip is depressed by rich fresh water water that feeds many forms of life.
I try to photograph these tights as if it comes to the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there is that way and not to exist that way again.
It's not the death when it's demanding, it's not an end, but a continuation of your way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the toxic therapies that I photographed is very young -- it's a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you are from a therapist that photographed in Kentucky, Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get a red shot.
Here it is.
You can see the left on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your floating line.
You can see here, it starts to roll up, the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is there.
This is a Grandparent iceberg of average size.
About 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so norms, the iceberg shows a different side of its personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every one of the same containers a baby. Okay.
So, two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to stop too much in the details of consciousness, because if you stop thinking about consciousness itself, you're not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm joined the X chromosome of the egg.
And in the other case, the X sperm chromosome joined the X chromosome of the egg.
Both of them come and start life.
Let's go back to talk about them later.
And in my activity I tend to fulfill two roles.
In one of my roles I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a historian for training and what I study in this case is the way people love anatomy -- to say, from human bodies and animals, how they have considered body flow, the idea of body, what have thought about the body.
The other role that I play in my work is an activist, as a patient advocate or, as I say sometimes improvisation of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with seven symbols, two people within a body.
I've worked with people with the longer, much lower people than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with attacked sex -- individuals whose physical therapist doesn't fit in male school and female feminists.
In general lines, we can call it interface.
Intelligent added many ways.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that don't get involved in male or female common forms.
For example, there is the case of the individual with the basis of Christmas companies whose Green Green Green gene, and it tells you the protections, that we all have in the fecal life, which becomes advanced.
And then, in the fecal life, testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks of testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the syndrome of instrumental to animations.
So, there are high levels of testosterone.
As a result, the body develops following a typical female course.
When the baby is born, the baby has a little girl.
It's a girl. It's a crash like a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the seats, but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having hards and sound, it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body something called survivor gangs.
They're in the back of the body.
Supermarket glands produce analogous, the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- and I think of a typical woman, I don't know their chromosome structure, I think it will be a typical woman most of the women like me are sensitive to animations.
We produce analog and respond to animations.
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the enemies that the woman who was born with testicles who have the syndrome of insurance to the analogos.
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that the interconnectedness are in the middle of the spectrum, in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example, a few years ago I received a call from a 19 years old and raised as a wall, I had a black, and sex relationships with her, I had a life as a guy, and I had just discovered that I had hardware and sound.
He had an extreme way of a disease known as super-making hyperbolic.
He had 2010 chromosomes and the uterus glasses were so active that, in essence, they created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, his genitals were massively, their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically males.
I was born with a child, nobody solved anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when I started having medical problems caused by the internal message, when the doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman.
Well, another quick example of a case of intervention.
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as the games, which is to say, they have an online tissue wrapped in temporary tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are lots of sex.
The reason why kids with this kind of body -- and they are facilitated, big symphony, or interventions, are subjected to normal surgery is not in order to guide a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why they're being subjected to various surgeries is that they're an threat for our social categories.
The system is normally based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up a particular identity.
We have the idea that it's going to be a woman is to have female identity, supposedly, being black means having African anatomy in historical terms.
terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with catastrophic.
So we have very romantic ideas in our culture to the individual.
Our nation is based on a concept of very romantic individuality.
Imagine how amazing it is to have kids who are born like two people within a body.
The biggest case is last year with the African common corridor Server, was put in trial of trial his sex in the Berkeley International Games.
Many journalists called to ask, "What is it going to be done to determine whether Campaign Service is man or woman?
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no example.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't bring a tourist line between men and women or between men and interpretations and international and international and interpretations, we're all of us who are tracking that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more progress the science is, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought they were stable anatomical categories that are running directly with stable innovation categories -- they're much more different than we thought.
And not only in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology allows it.
So as you see, we get in a written terrain.
So, for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of DNA with chimpanzees.
What do we operate from the fact that they differ from them in just a few nuclear?
And as we progress in science we get more and more in an awkward area where we have to recognize that the simple categories that we manage are probably too simplistic.
And we're looking at this in all sorts of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and at the end of life.
It's hard to look at a moment from which a body becomes human, and it has different rights from the photos.
There are very academic discussions today -- not in public, but I know within medicine -- when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to translate with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of them put a pen in front of the nose, and if they were still not going to get it.
If you stop moving it out.
But today we can, for example, to extract vital organs from a body and put it into another body.
And as a result, we need to face the dilemma to really determine somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could alter someone like me.
And in politics I'm progressive, I mean people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
He told that these categories are much more unstable.
And I have the concept of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a failure of the Facebook parents.
I know they were racing, I know they were secret, but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I found each other so much to see that music sound "Free, and not by the music, which is totally passion.
That's what happened in 1786 with the Fate Forest.
The Facebook fathers were for me, the first anatomy activists and explained why.
What they rejected was an anatomical concept and they replaced it with another one that was radical and beautiful and kept for 200 years.
And as everybody remembers -- what our parents rejected was the idea of monitor. Money was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world monkeys didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they came to the political power for the blood rights of the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The Facebook fathers rejected that idea and replaced it by a new anatomic concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They would give up the game field and decided that the anatomy that mattered was in common and not the anatomic differences -- that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of an informed system where two things were wasted.
It was wasting democracy and at the same time born science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of the Facebook parents, that many were very interested in science and the idea of a natural world.
They were distributed from the supernatural explanations and so they rejected the concept of being able to transplant them by getting from an idea empty of birth.
They were moving towards a natural concept.
And if we look, for example, the Declaration of Indonesia, talk about nature and the God of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in fact, they were transforming us the idea of analog coincidence.
And by doing so, they were sitting on the basis of the future Civil Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women survey.
Then I came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the California Stanford movement, who said, "I'm not a woman."
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, color people who are going to go back to the analog collapse on the analog difference, and again, they survive.
We see the same with the Disorders movement.
The problem is, of course, that as we look at the contexts we have to start asking why we keep certain digitals.
But attention, I want to keep some anatomical divisions in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we had to bring up to the anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five year-old children were allowed to have sex or married.
There are some anatomical divisions that make sense and I think we should maintain it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two concerns at the beginning of this talk.
We have two beings -- both of the lines in 1975 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary was born three months before time 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in terms of the time of March 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to the sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to debate.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because he has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other random regulations to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- I haven't told you if it's X, in virtue of being considered a man now is to be able to be aware of the mandatory evolution that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary on the side, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So you still have anatomical categories that in many ways are problems and questionable.
And now the question is: What do we do now that science goes so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a based democracy in anatomy could destroy?
I don't want to go to science, but at the same time, I sometimes feel like science is scaled.
Where are we going?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of a pragmatic attitude, "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do it."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at a certain moment has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosomes and to marry a woman you have to have crime.
Now, in practice they don't do the charity of the people.
But this is also very strange about the story I told you at the beginning of the instrumental syndrome to the analogores.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, and he has a solution.
It says that we should judge people "not not in the color of their skin but the content of their character, going beyond anatomy.
And I mean, "Yes, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do you judge people based on the content of your character?
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we should be based on this to give people right to people, because I have to admit that I know from some removed strings that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some libraries that I know can make more informed decisions and intelligent and mature decisions about their sexual relationships than people from 40 I know.
So how do you put the issue of the character content.
It's very difficult.
And a part of me is wondering what will happen if the character of a person could in the future being measured with an instrument, maybe with a magnetic resonance of it.
Do we really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States continue to guide this correct of thinking in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to be killed, unless it's willing to join a sex change, in which case it's allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon I talked to a couple of years ago that I had made light bit of symbols and then to separate it up and get his fame out.
But when the phone asked him the reason for the operation -- a very risky operation -- I thought in that other country these kids would be very killing and therefore I had to do it.
And what I said, "Well, has the political asylum rather than savings separate?
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are not forced to change for the good of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to finish I mean I've been talking a lot about the parents.
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it could have been, if we had given more participation to the mothers.
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist -- and it is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different analog societies, particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in interface, I've also been interested in researching sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about traditional studies is that women, on average, not all, but on average, they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to occupy those who are vulnerable within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in the passion, one of my colleagues who knew that I was interested in feminist -- I was considered feminist females, like now, made me a strange plant.
"Tell me what female feminist.
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with defending gender stereotypes, so there's nothing female in the feminist.
But the more I have thought about the question, the more I have seemed to be a feminine thing in the family.
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more attention to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So, if the parents were very aware of finding the way to protect people on the state of the state, it's possible that, to have invested more mothers to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond anatomy beyond anatomy -- think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more in relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect meeting, we think what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go live and work, it has the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents themselves.
Well, right now, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell a single city willing to get it.
But the amazing thing about cities is that it goes much more than their building cost much more.
So we could easily deliver it to the world, perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But just replaced by apartment buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment were already owners and that the other half still is missing to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to make the capacity in all existing buildings.
But you know the problem that you face is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the pollens and the distractions of construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those socialists.
But they could go to a whole new place, building a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that easy place built it in time of putting them together.
So I proposed that governments create new areas of reform big enough to continue cities, and I gave them a name, low stations.
I later learned that more or less at the same time, Jack and Arabic were thinking about the challenge of reform.
They knew that every year about 75,000 pounds would fall out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 Hongstone went through a displayed constitutional crisis.
In the next few elections, Pete Love was pregnant with a platform in which I promised reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
I asked Oculer to be his gas of galaxy.
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of restaurant, trial and error and a lot of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under their most essential ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and bother all the current apartments of apartments.
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies, but they need so much of technologies as a progress to progress and usually are the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to eighth a link with TEDTalk.
I showed it to Jack.
They called me.
They said, "Let's get this to the leaders of our country?
So in December we met in Miami in a conference room.
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are, much more valuable than their monetary cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York -- present, terrors that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause -- Italy said, "Well, maybe we could see the video Talk video.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a low standard city is a place where you start with straight terrain, a statue that specifies the rules that apply there and an option for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of Hongstories called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way for our country forward.
He asked me to go to Toroxic and talk about the four and five of January again.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to generate a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of Denay and the white line is the new airport that built in Denay.
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the humoros that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that measures at least 10,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody else applaud circular.
The public faces were very serious and attention.
The conflict of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Thank you Roman, thank you very much for your talk, but maybe you could see the TED Talk video.
I have it here in my computer."
So I felt and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explains how essential a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you might be able to be in Hongstories, rather than hundreds of miles away.
And they also include new options for leaders.
Because the Hongstowore government leaders needed help of associated countries, they could benefit from the associated countries that would help us establish and make the rules of the statue, so that everybody could trust the status that is effectively completely.
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily about a thousand square miles.
And soon after that, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to find their constitution and add a constitutional device that allowed to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this painful crisis, the voting in the Congress in favor of this constitutional embedded was 120 to one.
All the parks, all the factors in society, the advantage.
To include the Constitution, you have to attack twice in Congress.
On February 17 again again in another voting of 112 to one.
Immediately after the vote. From 21 to 24 percent of February, a delicious of about 30 honor was to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big center of the city that is being built in South Korea, is bigger than the Boston center.
All you see there was built in four years, after it spent four years getting the permission.
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they have built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that allows the administrators to come from, and at the same time allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow its Supreme Court to be the ultimate take for this new judicial system.
There are buildings and cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of subjects.
There are many companies that want to install in the Americas, especially in a place with a trade zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
There are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million dollars a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family in order to go and get a job, sometimes are solid mothers who have to earn the money for just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are children who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in Hongstows."
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insects so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new resilience?
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends had asked me to say, "Thank you."
I'm Jesus, and this is my value.
But before I show you what there is inside there, I'm going to make a public trust, and it is that I live obsessed with the suit.
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and publish in my blog brought up, colorful and different for each other.
But he didn't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is a second hand of pulse markets and second hand.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my ball in the environment and in my wallet in my pocket.
I come to know people who are interested in, usually my money goes to a good cause. My aspect is unique, and buying it becomes my personal search for training.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I'll be from my shark?
I would like color."
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to my value, I want to tell you what I'm excited for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone who has all that clothes?
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought up.
I've brought seven pairs of internal clothing and nothing else.
Interestingly right for exactly a week is everything I've put in my value.
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you get here to Palm Spring.
And because they don't know me as the woman walking through TED in the inner clothes,  that means I found some things.
And I would like to show you now the steps for this week.
Does it not sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that I believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is called bright ticket.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see you for less than 50 dollars.
All the content, including the jacket, it costs me 55 -- and it's the most expensive thing I've been used in the week.
Monday, color is energy.
It's almost physically impossible to be bad humor, when you're seeing a brilliant red screen.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
Mars is shocked.
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
It's just yourself.
If you surround the right people, you're not just going to understand, you also appreciate you.
Missours, Guardian that you carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the distractions, or I remember them to their seven years.
I like to go and say, "Thank you."
Jonas: trust is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost safe that you are.
And if you think you don't see well with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't have to look at you you can't attract it.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
Virginia? A universal truth six words for you, the donation disappeared goes with everything.
And finally, Saturday, to develop a personal style and only a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people came up to me this week just by what I was using -- and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously, this is not going to go into my little value.
So before I go home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to get emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, color and brilliant suit, if there's a little love in my heart and look for it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we use a scale to measure the application of each hemisphere -- we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where do you put your brain in this scale?
Some of these will be optimized by one of these extremes -- but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great appeal in both homework at the same time.
It's not that it will be excited.
You can be logic and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, that just like most of the other experimental quantum physicists we need quite logical to connect these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this interview? Well, we like to play with things.
We are going to play with them, and then we see how they react to them, and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
Some intuition that you can have developed over the years is the one that says one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you wouldn't be born with this notion -- they developed it.
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
He was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, she always fell down.
But I bet that the game of that parking bar taught him a valuable lesson -- and it is that big things don't allow them to pass them, and they remain in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars with these strange little particles.
And when they play their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics theory.
At that point you found physics a few years ago, you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need it to describe the big objects around us every day.
That doesn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a particles.
But it doesn't fit well to my logical part.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then shouldn't it be going to follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it shouldn't be.
And so I felt much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why I was a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in a quantum mechanical manifestation.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here's a little bit here. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a very large approach to the small metal tragic.
What we see is a little bit of a metal picture, with a travel of trauma and that keeps support in a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way you do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I got all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this fragment of swimming pilot that is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superpower, but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how cool it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people come up I stop doing those things, because I don't want them to bother them, or, actually, scared.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The journey companies of inanimate objects are not just people -- it's also the light that goes through it and the wind that goes on to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to expand all the other passengers to it.
And that's what we did.
We turn the lights off, then we introduced a vacuum and we extract all the air, and then we plug it into a temperature of less than a degree above the absolute zero.
Now, by being just in the elevator, the little piece of metal is free to act as it wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of being perfectly concern, I was vibrating -- and the way I vibrating it was like a breathing like this -- as a fan that expands and contract.
And by giving you a supermarket supercomputer, we could make it vibrate and not fly at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing is vibrating and doesn't fly at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the bits of atoms that are confident that are confident -- that piece of metal is meeting and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's only in certain instant when those are all closed.
In the rest of the time they're decorating.
I mean, every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It's worth going into a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is roughly the same as the difference between that metal of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you also too."
I mean, it's my logical part that I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was devastating in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we heat it, and we turn the lights and we look inside the box, we saw that the metal went out there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator actually are quantum objects that are just doing in a small space.
You hear a lot about quantum mechanics that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It is more profound than that.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep radical of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is Amazon.
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my boss that is here and allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months to me.
Many negotiations and stories, I assure you, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the demand.
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining in this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I went from a big education -- I didn't complain about it, but I had no access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and going to museums I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than showing the demo and then explaining a couple of interesting things that we've taken from their launch.
So just -- we go to the Georgeton.
Look around all the museums that there are.
There's the Social Gallery Gallery -- the Moore, the Gurgmand, the Richard, the Golden Vance.
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, the Medical Museum in New York City.
There are two ways of doing it -- very simple.
We click and fire, and we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, Bomba or Mexico, that doesn't really matter.
You move around and you have fun.
Do you want to navigate the museum, right?
We open up the flat floor, and with a single click, we jump inside.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the pathology.
They divide forward.
Explore.
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The Congressionals, by Pieter British at Medical Metropolitan.
I see the season B.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the metaphorical information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the giant technology.
So this picture, for example, contains about 10,000 million pieces.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million pieces?
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million dollars.
It can be done around very simple.
You see funny things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do it.
So I started playing to play, and I found something that happened there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems interesting.
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
So I had a little research. I talked to some people from the Metropolitan -- and I actually discovered that this is a game called "slippery, which is to hit an eye with a pale of Carbon marriage.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper in depth and see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you can actually see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we go quickly to save the MoMA in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorite "a stage.
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the planes?
And if you want to see how Van Golden actually created this teacher work?
I really increase it and really do it.
I go to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is "The Stringer night? I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are a lot more things here, but I don't have time to show you.
This is the really cool part. It's called "The Ways.
All of you, absolutely everyone, doesn't matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a man, that's the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple: we enter -- I've created this function that I call "the power of the rest -- we just made a story around it.
It's about "The Americans, in the National Gallery of London.
You can take things, send them to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you consider these master works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium makes a justice to your art work, and it's actually represented online.
And the big question that they do today is, "Can I do this to repeat the experience of going to a museum, "What?
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think it's a period, a flying piece.
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I'm from Italian origin, all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of its bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that something really interesting has happened in the formula of Fiberian 1 in the last two decades.
A long time ago, if you wanted to win a figure of Fiberian 1 career, you took a budget and you put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what the engineering system is called real time.
It's essentially a system that has two components, a sensor and an access.
Today what's interesting is that control systems in real time are beginning to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronic choices.
They're becoming computer computers.
And as such, they're starting to respond differently, and they can be detected and accessible.
The cities are a big thing.
As I noticed I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the world's cortex but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of energy consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these detection and attitudes are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of Palestinian Pierre for weekends in the MoMA during the summer.
It's called "The Tom Tomorrow."
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to talk.
In a way, it's like almost all existing atoms become sensors and activists.
And that's changing the interaction that we as humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Michael note.
You know, when Muhammad climbed the Mosscon, he says that at the end he took the hammer, and he would throw it to the Mot -- you know, you can still see a little bit of a little bit of a milk underneath it, and he said, "Would you not speak?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to talk.
And I'm going to show you just some examples, insist in the idea of capturing the environment and accepting something.
Let's start with depression.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup of the world.
Maybe some of you remember it, playing Italy and France, and at the end of Zipcar it gave the church.
And anyway, at the end won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at activity happened in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the Columbia in the middle and the Twitter River.
It's morning, before play.
The time line is at the top.
On the early afternoon, there are people over here and there doing calls, moving around.
It starts the party, silence.
Frank Golden de Italy.
They engage, people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of the regulation time.
First extra time, second time.
Zippant, and at a moment, the church.
Gand Italian, yes.
That night everybody went to celebrate the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day they all went to the center at the center of the winning team and the prime minister of then.
And then everybody down.
You see the image of the place called Carter Mars where, from the ridge time, people are going to celebrate -- it's a big party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of depression, it's not about people, but things that we use and consume.
Today we know all about the processing of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that are going to be a Mac -- how it was standing.
But we know very little about where things go.
And so in this project we developed some small tags to track the trash in its professional by the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle recently more than one year ago to label what they were running, different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all sort of touched it.
Then we put a little chip and a tag on the trash and then we started tracking it.
These are the results.
Start from Seattle."
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are many innovations in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist.
They're happening complicated things, and there's a lot of unnecessary transportation.
But the other thing we think we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we shoot doesn't disappear, which is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the plastic bottle that we run one day is still there.
That if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That's the reason for the project.
My colleague, American Berlin, could tell us much more about detection and many other great things we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we mentioned at the beginning, which is associated about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Karajada.
It all started with a question from the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology -- new technology, will it join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop -- it was imagine that you have a coffee and valves, solidarity valves that open and shut down.
It's created as a water classification, with water pieces.
If you make the pixels you can write in them, you can show patterns, images, text.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can go by, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the Bell Peter.
He liked a lot.
And he described a commission to design the building into the entrance of the Expo.
We call it Palestine Water.
The whole building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when you appreciate it to be open so you can happen.
The roof is also covered of water.
And if there's a little wind, if you want to minimize the captivity, you turn your roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappeared, like in this case.
That day there will always be somebody in the winter when you go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, "The building the building."
No, it's not that they have demanded it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture disappears.
Here is working.
You see people who are intrigued by what happens inside.
And here I am trying to not die by testing the sensors that open water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in Karajad came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let it happen, but a building that kept making corners and water holes, and you had to jump up to not fly.
(Audience noises) And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And it's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pieces, the water pixels and the projects of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine that they could have little helicopter in the air, and that each one had a little piece of piece that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud.
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the fingers.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appeared in different scales and sizes.
And then all of that could be a piece of pixels in 3D, where you can zoom in, and go through it, and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real controlled Flock, going down to form a V, like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them control by a person.
We can have every pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with Robert Bolly -- the best battery dancers of today, the New York Methodology star and the McDonald's Scoulder, to capture their movements in 3D and use it as an input for the Florida.
Here we can see Robert dancing.
On the left you see the pieces, the capture in different resolution.
It's so much distribution 3D in real time as a movement capture.
It can rebuild the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, the color and the movement, with gravity and rotation with it.
We want to use this as a possible input for February.
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the cloud.
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment -- as a clouds of clouds, like a cloud crime, but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody put a little bit for a loss.
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we move from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time, the Obama campaign showed us, we can move from the digital world, the self-organizing power of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may want to use it to design and make a symbol of it.
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today, think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how do we go from digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pieces.
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered out of piece.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, it will serve to share the main moments of the 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can rise, like a new top of London.
You can get there.
As if it was a new digital party at night, but most importantly, it will be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than you are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve memory, for a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and certain of themselves?
What about good health?
Or maybe they're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else would you like it?
What would you like if you could choose something?
(Audience: creativity. creativity.
How many people will choose creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
A few of them probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you will choose the memory?
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about longevity.
Oh, most of all, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of them the world would be very different.
Is it just imagination?
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a subject here in the TED Conference today, but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great genocide of the 20th century -- TED, Doca, who also built in the Operation Orienty Russia, wrote a team called "The Bible in biology makes sense.
But if you effectively accept biological evolution consider this, it's just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch -- well in an end, is, of course, the one that interest us.
Let's start from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In the interface there has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of horizons.
Some have gone back and forth.
We've been here about 130 years old.
It might seem that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
Do you realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human insulin that is used to treat diabetes.
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein -- in the species of the pancreas that comes out of the pancreas of the world.
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the most bacterial intestine that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio Darkeles would tell you about cartoonist, think about bacteria think?
The gut is a wonderfully hospital environment for those bacteria.
It's warm, dark -- high, it's very analyzing.
And we're going to provide all of the nutrients that can want without effort from their part.
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some force to the output.
But by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help to digest essential nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future leave us?
Are we in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or are you destined to become something different, maybe better adapted to the environment?
In this vast integrating symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief company, the animal kingdom, as one and only compassion, and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the entertaining part of this talk so I hope you've enjoyed it.
When I got to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the universal organisms, every cell simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters of that cell.
But when the multicellular organisms show up, things start to change.
It enters sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction.
In fact, you could say that the inevitability of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was college student, I thought, well, surprisingly, surprisingly, death per sex, it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year I went on, I had more doubt.
I came to understand George Burns feelings who still perform in Las Vegas in the age of 90 years.
And one night someone hit their hotel door.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a magnificent light dancing dance.
He looks at it, and he says, "You know what a sex "computer.
All right, he says, "The sound of the solid?
I realized, as a doctor, that I was working by a different target to the goal of evolution, not necessarily controlled, just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
He wanted us to stay healthy.
I wanted to recover health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to spend the genome to the next generation and adapt and support generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, and I are like record rockets designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let it fall into the sea.
I think we all understand the feeling that Woody Allen expressed when he said, "I don't want to achieve the immortality through my work.
I want to make it not died."
Evolution is not necessarily favorable to longevity.
Not necessarily favor to the largest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest one.
The evolution favors of creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
At the bottom of the ocean, the temporal bacteria that can survive the heat of the business that they produce, if there were fish there, fisheries the vacuum -- yet they've managed to make that a risk environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward to the next phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that we don't evolve.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've been able to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been discarded and removed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we've continued our environment to adapt to us as well as we adapt to him.
And by the way, we migrated -- we closed, and we are so excited that no longer is possible to have the isolation of isolation for evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce an evolution of traditional type, natural type, propelled by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would be, that the evolutions of evolution are departed by despair, but they're inflated.
And in terms of isolation, when you kind of contact a different planets that are going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility -- a approach, interconnected and frightening.
The New New Evidence, the new evolution, which is not simply nature, but guided and choosing for us as individuals in the decisions that we make.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First, we consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more varieties than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what it takes at the individual level and family.
Think also that if you were possible to be able to choose not only the sex of your offspring. But in your own body making your genetic approaches to cure or prevent diseases.
And if we could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the application?
Would you not want to make those changes in your genes.
If you look at the future that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and it was 13 years old.
It costs 2,000 million dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost near the age of 20,000 and in a week.
It's not going to fail a lot to make it really the human genome for $100,000 and be getting more and more at the rise of everyone.
Those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce immunity.
Believe it, or there's no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against influence in the cells of a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the stake?
That's reality today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little changes.
Can they change the cells of their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their destruction?
And if they could change the sperm and the clips, or change the recent college computer, and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating hunger, reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want healthier children.
And then, that same analog technology, that same motor of science that can produce changes to prevent disease is going to allow us to also adopt the testing substitution of the beating memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken Jennifers especially if you could increase with the next generation of the Watson machine.
Why don't we have a contract muscle that allows us to run faster and more distance?
Why not live longer time?
This is going to be irrelevant.
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to become the evolution of before in the neocortex.
We're going to take a process that could normally take 100,000 years and we can compress it to 1,000 years, and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to get to them.
Are we going to use these choices in a better society, more successful society, more considered?
Or are we going to selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
Are we going to build a society that is more boring and more unifice or more very slightly and more versus?
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all, are we going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit wisdom necessary to make these supply decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what I could think about, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're about 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by making a click of a car, click up.
Click, click, click -- sound striking.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the 18.
It was the only one who could talk to flight attacks.
So I looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. We probably hit some birds.
The pilot had already looked at the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot opened the airplane with the Hudson River.
It's usually not the route.
Turn the engines off.
Imagine being in an airplane and without noise.
And then three words.
The three more distributed words I've heard.
He said, "I'm going to go for impact.
I didn't have to talk more with the flight assistant.
I could see it in his eyes.
It was terrible. Life was finished.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to report, all the experiences I've wanted to have and never had.
As I thought about that later -- I came up with a sentence, which is: "The "brandrist.
Because if the wine is ready, the person is there, I'm going to open it.
I don't want to apply anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we avoid George Washington Bridge -- which was not for a lot -- I thought about -- I mean, I really feel a big special.
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, I tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives my ego as well.
And the time that I wasted in things that didn't matter with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a medium in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels about wonder.
I no longer try to have reason, I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock goes down -- "And 14, 13, 13.
You see the water coming out.
I'm saying, "Please fly.
I don't want this to break into 20 pieces as you see in those documents.
And as we were born, I had the feeling of, "Oh, I'm not afraid of it.
It's almost like we've been preparing for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to go, I love my life.
And that sadness is embedded in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in an act of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of art talent --    And scream.
And to me, that was the whole reason of being the world.
At that point, I understood that by connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
Throughout all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I got a miracle to me, not to die that day.
And I became another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and coming back and living differently.
You are flying today, the challenges to imagine that the same thing happens in your plane -- and please do not be like that, but imagine and how do you change?
What would they do, that they still hope to do because they think they're going to live forever."
How do they change their relationships and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, are the best parents that they can."
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many amazing projects.
But the most great thing I worked on was for this guy.
The guy is called Texas.
Technology was one of the most important graffiti in the 1980s.
He came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a horrible in the legs?
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today I have a total paralysis.
It can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and respect in the art world.
So we decided we were going to engage Tony Textback, and to his cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with it?
And his brother said, "I want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me?
And I said, "A second, is it not that -- I see Stephen Hawking, is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those departments?
And he said, "No, unless you are somebody important, you have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people.
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anyone to see the movie "The Scottish and the margin?
They communicate in that way, they are running with the finger.
I said, "That's archive. How can you be?
So I introduced myself with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that I signed a check that had no idea how I was going to cover it.
I committed to her brother and his father there at that point -- "All right, this is the treatment. Tony is going to talk about, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in their inner can't be communicated?
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called Ghana Leonerd Redwood, which have a technology that allows them to project a light in any surface, and then with a laser point, draw about that and record negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that come up, they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
They first start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and at the end, people start making art.
But there was always a cycle of life in its presentation.
And so I started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization, and so much of a lot moving things from one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we went to the doors of the insurance companies, and we got a machine so that Tesa could communicate, a machine like Stephen Hawking at Stephen Hawking's disease.
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most fun -- I call it Port because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't deserve it. This guy's fantastic.
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world -- all of the entire world of the planet to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and controversial and anti-accidents took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we did something completely stupid and when we went back to have taken the walls out of the walls and instead would have gratitude.
But for two weeks we said, we went to the shipping of Venice, my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called England -- and you can see the description here.
They are a couple of cheap gasses that we bought in the shipping set of Venice Beach, some collection wire and things from Homo Derek and Radio Shara.
We take a CD. We opened it, we put it on a light of LED and now there is a device that is free -- by building yourself -- we publish the free code, software goes down.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, "No."
There is no hospital that can say, "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the Tears room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this blood and added during the great inflation.
And after over a year of planning, two weeks of programming -- intense sessions of all night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and he's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a project on a wall of the hospital partnership.
And he was going to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and he would imagine what was the feeling in the parking one.
The funny thing was that we had to drag in the parking lot, so we felt like we were writing the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody eventually came to rescue and pull me out of there so I could breathe.
Isn't it wonderful?
In a way, that's our war scream.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go with this.
It's a great device, but it's the equivalent of a Malay screen.
Someone with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and routine.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many prizes.
Remember, it's free, none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were from the guy, "Oh, this is fantastic.
Aristotle played something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- this is what ends up to close the circle, is that in April this year at the MIT Center at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called "The State in the Street?
And Country in the streets is going to have the best employers of the urban art exponentially, Shakespeare Facebook, Canada, all of them will be there.
I'm going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea, if you see something that's not possible, making possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- stage, the computer, the microphone, the Stanford, nothing was possible at some point.
Make possible, anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with illegal recognition technology, I just recognize something and it was associated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all all day to do every day when you find something that you feel like you have to do. If you're not now, when, and if I'm not me, who is me?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years getting into very difficult situations and at the same time a so dangerous.
I went to prison, hard.
I worked on a coal mine, dangerous.
I filmed in war zones, difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this, fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been immersed in situations in horrible situations with the only goal of trying to try and examine social issues in ways that are attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyze it in a way that you see entrepreneurs and accessible for the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk about the world of brands and the pathology I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, a car in Egypt.
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered in sale the rights of my TEDTalk TEDTalk network.
What I had was this: "Hey Street Now, my TEDTalk who have no idea what it comes like and in content could explode in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company when you do it.
But this is a very good media opportunity.
Do you know how many people look at these TEDTalks."
Thank you.
It's a title in progress, by the way.
So even with that barrier I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I wouldn't have been able to tell you with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we examine the world of marketing -- the advertising world.
And as I said before, I've been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could prepare me, nothing could anticipate -- for something that was so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan School, I want to do a film that comes from the production of products and marketing and advertising, and that all the film is funded with put out of products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The biggest movie ever selling?
What happens in "The biggest film ever sold -- is that everything from top to bottom, from beginning to end, has market images, all the time, from the puzzle that appears before the title, the X brand.
Now this brand -- I mean, Stanford Stanford, the State Center."
These people are associated with the film to persuasion, forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- (Audience Katrina, is that reduction? Is it what? (Audience: Is it reduction?
I'm a redundant pill.    I just say that. It was more for accidents.
It was "The Percentage. forever."
But not only are we going to have the fiber of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure we're going to ensure all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the most great shoe you've used ...
The most great car that you have led to the biggest film ever sold -- the best job you have been driven, the biggest film of "The Great Great Civil Campaign.
Karajad Karland, the idea is then also to show the brands as part of life -- making them finance the film --  (Audience: And we actually show you the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all the film of principle at end.
And I would love that GDP helps to make it happen.
Robert Franklin, you know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that, it's the maximum respect for the audience.
Gold, yet I don't know how recent people are going to be like to be the people.
XL: You have a perspective, I don't know if "The "button, it's very negative, but you know how it's going to refuse? (Audience: No idea, David Colombia, how much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half a half. (Audience: All right, John Karl, I think it's going to be hard to meet with them, but that certainly is worth convincing a couple of big brand.
FN: Who knows, perhaps for the moment that the movie comes out of the film, we see a lot of joyful idiots.
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart Russia." Most responses will be "no?
MS: But it's going to be hard to sell it, for the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: I mean, you're not very optimistic.
So they help me? I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. (Audience: Okay. Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what the brands.
MS: Yeah. (Carbon, that's the challenge, when you look at the people you have to treat it?
MK: We have some places where to go.
MS: I thought the camera meant we have a conversation out of microbes.
It turns out the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your film.
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And it was very impressive, I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, making so many people saw it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the separate media is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the masses.
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a gay mistake, and that mistake was this.
No, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images from Boyle in Google --   This is one of the first images that appear.
I like your way of running, Sergey British. No.
This was the problem: transparency, free of simulation or deception -- easily detected or see, easily understandable -- which is characterized by visualizing or accessible of information, especially in business practices, being the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians name, the president of the name, even the Clinison name.
But suddenly when you try to make it really change something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives fear --  like that rare bear that is still regulating.
Is it impressive.   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is that angry?
They eat a whole cup of Coke White.
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and telling us that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to tell the history of the story.
We want you to tell a story, but that you tell "the story "The Stones.
See, when I was a kid, and my father stuck me in some lie -- that's him looking at it, he said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, there's my story, and it's the real story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency would like to help -- and that just because I knew John Bonobo and Richard Kurther of many years, I realized I would have to go to my own, I would have to take it back and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to talk about suddenly -- I started to realize, is that when you start to think with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge movies, giant and others who make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies, giant people say the reason their movies have so much success is due to the associated brands they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of Hollywood?
And the film is called "The biggest movie ever saved."
How are we going to look at Bang in the movie?
Every time I am to go out, every time I open my boat, you'll see the Bangladesh desert.
At any time during an interview with somebody who can say, "Are you good for this interview."
Are you ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want to help you know.
Maybe you should put a little bit of this before the interview.
And there's one of these fabulous grands there.
Both "Come Florida, like "The Park of Park, are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as for women, solid, ball, barbaria, like that.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a personalized look.
Karen Frank." We are a small brand.
They similar to the kind of smaller movies that I told you, we're rather a rival framework.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remembering Ben to people is the reason why this is interested.
MS: What words will you use to describe Bang?
Bang is in white.
KS: That's a big question.
Woman:
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put in the life.
Man: Let's talk about something auditory, fresh stuff.
I think "The "Come is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus "settlements the smell and scan?
You keep you cold.
How do we keep the stream longer. With better fraction, more fractal, more fractal, three times more fresh times.
Things like those who hold the benefits.
MS: And that's a multi-third-looking company.
What about me? What about a common guy?
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the common Palest.
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your frame?
Man: My market?
I don't know.
I like the good clothes.
Woman: It will get the '80s, "not put it to less than it is dance.
MS: All right, what is the German brand for?
Gorgen, something unique. (Audience: unique. Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a dark block.
I like dark colors, many gray grass and things like this.
Usually I take access as a sunglasses, or I like crystals and similarities.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a classic "branding, Mercaration Ben Benjamin.
Man 2: The brand I am, I call it "slip category."
Woman 2: In the hippie part of it, in part of it, in a container part of Brazil, I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of mass.
They sell toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is Fed, because I delivered the market.
Man 5: Mars transportation failure.
Is that something?
Allender? I'm a lawyer.
Voice: I'm Tom.
MS: Well, we can't all be brand Tom, but I often focus on the intersection of dark internal and "slip category.
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help us understand what they call the brand "mathematician.
And I found a company called Obama Zatchings in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like Gold, February: College to discover that brand personality.
If you could do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
Audience: The photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a family photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people model my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world in which you live, like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things are original and start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, the West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like the different things.
I like weird things. I like weird things.
A: Tell me about "the "baseball? What does that mean?
What's the magic? What phase of place do you find now?
Why is it important? What does the red do?
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other medical medicines have had it?
You have to have fear. What kind of mountain is you running?
MS: AIDS. (CA: Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patient. (Audience: Great job." A, thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy in all this.
Linda Zatching: The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but complexity, in your brand personality brand, brand Mountain Square is a concern brand.
They are very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only focused on one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- which is human nature, to avoid things that are not sure, avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them a little bit positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic one, Apple.
And you can see here to Takea, Will, Minister of Mike Cooper and Leone.
Now there are leadership marks and conscious marks -- those things that have gone up and forth, but a physical brand is quite powerful.
MS: A physical brand -- what's your flam?
If someone asks you to describe your brand identity, your brand personality -- what would you be?
Are you an attack attacked? Are you somebody who makes blood flow?
Or are you a distant attack.
A little bit more calm -- removed, conservation?
The usual attributes are like being a phrase to be fresh, like the prince will be content as the prince -- contemporary -- anticipation, adding or bold like Europe February, fast or girl, professional, dominant, magic or mystic like Gandhi.
Or are you more from all attacks.
You're conscious, sophisticated like 700."
Are you statistically, traditional project, protective, protective, you can identify with Open?
Are you trust, stable, family, reliable trust, safe, sacred or sand, like the Dalai Lama or YouTube."
And in the course of this movie, we had over 500 companies, angry and destruction, who said, "No, you didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
It allowed us to tell the story of neuroscience, and we came to tell the story in this film of how they now use magnetic resonance to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing as for movies.
We went to San Paulo. We went to San Paulo.
All over the city over the last five years there is no valley, there's no cartoons, there's no floor, nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are making a way in schools with leadership problems in America.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or the ones I've had more success are those where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took the interfaces, they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat the artist directly.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about the way we look at the world.
And how do you get it? Would you succeed.
Well, since the movie goes into the South Station, let's take a look.
According to Burning the movie is standing in January, and since then, this is not all, we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covered only a period of two and a half weeks.
That's only online, no press, no TV.
The film is still not distributed yet.
It's still not online. It's not in stress.
It's not even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talk to their customers will not be part of.
I have always believed that if you get up, if you take risks, you take risks in those risks.
I think when you take people out of that you're pushing them to failure.
I think that when you train their employees in the risk aversion is preparing your whole company to lack rewards.
I feel like what has to happen to go forward is that we have to encourage people to risk.
We have to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities that they can manage.
Ultimately, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear on a cage.
Let's add fear. We add the risk.
From a saying at a time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to take to transparency.
More than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk "The Transparency has been presented by my good friends of Explosive who were in 1985 bought the rights of the name in Elland.
OK, turning big data into great opportunities for companies around the world.
Explosive presents "The Translation."
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, Mozart, on behalf of transparency, who happened exactly with those 1577?
MS: It's an exceptional question.
In my pocket I have a name of the name of the TED Mars organization, the Sarah Foundation, a charge for 50 to be applied to my TED next year.
The idea behind the Spanish computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the proportion of Urapusta in Nathan.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speed and valves we can cause a lot of problems with center.
The gray boxes don't use Woman software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a Windows effective virus in a laptop computer used by an engineer to keep this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the plan behind Steven.
We started with a Windows.
The eye goes into the gray box -- damage the center, and the Iranian nuclear program is demanding, completely completely missing.
Is it easy, right?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started investigating about Sweden six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown to it.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex at the Water part -- the installation used multiple vulnerability data.
It seemed to want to do something with these gray boxes, these control systems.
That called us the attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with Steven and we saw what happened with this.
So there were very strange things.
Syrian is behaving as a lab of lab that he didn't like our cheese, and he smelled it, but he didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after I experimented with different cheese knows, I realized, and I thought, this is a direct attack.
It's completely counterintuitive.
The installation is looking at actively in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that's trying to infect is effectively working in that place.
If not, Sweden doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I thought, "We don't know what's the goal?
It might be, let's say for example, a U.S. energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than we will discover the target.
So we extracted and we discovered the code of attack, and we found that it was structured in two digital bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very privileged armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They knew all the points that they attack for.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the installation of Syndy is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much the old anti-accident language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at terrorists and data structures and we tried to relate to the real world, with potential targets in the real world.
We need theories about defense that we can approve or disappear.
In order to get to the goals on goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent knife, it must be a valuable white white white white white white -- because it's where most infections have been reported.
You don't find several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear energy plant of Burning and to the engineering plant.
So I told my assistant, "Do you have a list of all the experts in training and energy plants between our clients.
I called them and I consulted them in an effort to keep their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital eye with the control of the road.
The road is that mobile part inside the center, that black object you see.
If you drive the speed of this robot, you can certainly break it up and even make the contact to explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and determine it in an obvious effort to go back to the nest maintenance engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to decode the big digital eye looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the 16-year-old number in that code, can't be obsessed.
I started researching scientific literature about how these contracts are built in Nathan, and I found that they are structure in what's called a cartoon, and every waterfall contains 16 centers.
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And he got better yet.
These Iran centers are divided in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the attack code.
It's a pretty identical structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had between hands.
So that there is no materialist, it wasn't that way.
The results have been given after several weeks of hard work.
We were often feeding in the streets without exit and we had to start again.
And yet, we found that both digital eyes were pointing on one and same goal, but from different angles.
The small eye is taking a waterfall and making it spinning the roles and reporter and the big eye communicates with six cards and manipulate values.
In the way, we're very confident that we have determined what the defense is.
It's Nathan, and it's just Nathan.
We shouldn't worry about other targets being achieved by Steven.
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, really impressed me.
There's the gray box, and you see the advances.
What this thing does is intervene the input values for example, from pressure sensors and vibration sensors and protective code, which still execute during the attack, with false input data.
And believe it or not, these fake input data are preserved by Steven.
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the robot, the security camera feeds programmed video.
Is it great there?
The idea here is obviously not only to throw the operators in the control room.
It's really much more dangerous and aggressive, actually.
The idea is to take a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, on an energy plant, when the big steam turbine is happening, you should open up scale valves in a millisecond million.
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're committed, then they can happen bad things.
The plant can exploit it.
And they don't operate it or the security system will notice it.
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is general.
It has nothing to do -- specifically, with antibodies, with engagement with urban.
It could also work too, for example, on an energy plant, or in a car factory.
It's general.
And you don't have -- you don't have -- that will disseminate this burden with a USB key, as we saw in the case of Starry.
You could also use conventional technology technology to develop them.
Develop the most possible.
And if you do that, with what you end up with is a character of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All green areas are spaces with great numbers.
We need to face the consequences and better we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
Ralph has been done in many sides that people assume that the Montana is the main entities behind this.
What's your opinion.
Ralph Law, OK, really want to hear this?
Yes, OK.
My view is that the Mountain is involved, but the engine is not Israel.
The engine behind this is cyber superconduction.
There is one alone, and it's the United States, fortunately, fortunately, fortunate.
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for adversity. Thank you, Rale.
I want you to imagine a robot that can be carried on and that gives you survival skills, or another one that makes you users of wheelchair to get up and go back to walk.
In "Decent Bible, we call these robots, exceptions.
It's nothing different from something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force -- that also increases its speed, and it helps you, for example, to handle balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and machine.
But not only that -- you can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other foreign things.
This is not an imagination idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier that, on average, you must take on your back a 45 pounds of color, and it's being managed to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage.
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help drive the issue.
Let me introduce you to the Hawaii -- or Portugal Carlies Universal Carlorators.
Soldier: With the Harvard exoskeleton I can run 90 pounds of variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows us to put in cookies to drag and execute movements with great agility movement.
I perceive what I want to do, or where I want to go and then increase my strength and my resistance.
Let me leave Benjamin, we're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new exoskeleton -- this year.
That is a reality.
So let's go back to the wheelchair users, which I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people on the wheels around the world.
About one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative calculation here.
We talk about something that happens with frequency -- very young people, with damage in the spinal column that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- bumping against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that they were infected quickly.
Her only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complicated compartment -- is the wheelchair chair.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful sensitivity, as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the rise that Amanda Bill is using Amanda Bill who was 19 years ago, and as a result, he couldn't walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda Barack, Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our eyes, I mentioned.
It has some sensors.
It's completely not invasive in the molecules that send signals to the fuel computer, here on the back.
So here is a little bit of batteries that give you energy to the motors in the hot, and in the knees, and they make it forward with this soft and very natural and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when by a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom stay like paradigm.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and everything from the fight down.
Shortly later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "Look, I'll never walk back again."
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last pizza of my being.
The adaptation technology since then, and it has allowed me to learn how to go down the bottom in standard, climb rocks and even ride in a hand bicycle.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life to future generations -- not just of soldiers, but to Amanda and all the users of wheelchair to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the battery, practice sex to say hot, and the game is the order of the day, where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man Alice or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild forests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known by their aggression.
But unfortunately, we've made too much emphasis in this aspect in our narrative of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, the terrifying society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where deadly violence has yet been observed yet.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least understanding of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the Congo, and it's been very difficult to study it.
The Congo is a paradox, an extraordinary biodiversity land and beauty, but also the heart of the tangream itself, stage of a violent conflict that has been spread for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the Bonobo, too.
Cancer meat and deforestation makes you can't fill up a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world, and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter by getting the trees.
Who are these cousins?
We know them as the apes "When the love, not the war -- because they have frequent sex and promote and bisexual to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the Bonobos life is more than the Karajan Salad.
Banks, like humans, love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to establish links and foster tolerance, to make it.
With him we learn to trust, and we learn the rules of the game.
Play increases creativity and resilience, and it has to do with the generation of diversity, diversity of interactions, diversity diversity diversity of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo game you see the evolutionary roots itself of laughter and dance and human rituals.
The game is the glue that binds us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken out of the wild environment.
First of all, it's a ball of ball a battle ball, and I don't talk about football picture.
Here's a female and a young male in the middle of a perspective.
Look what she is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, the pressure of the balls.
I think I think in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common so much in Bonobos and in humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows this video, this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- and also how the game requires trust and foster trust, and at the same time it's the most fun.
But the game is pollinating.
The game is pollinating, it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more truck, imagination, curious, maybe the place where the awe is represented.
And I want you to see, this is Australia, a young female female who's playing with water quantitative.
I think that we sometimes play alone, and we explore the limits of our inner and foreign worlds.
And it's that light curiosity that drives us to explore and then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual shame of creativity.
These are just small samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, play is our act of adaptation.
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But would we bring it to the maximum our game capacity.
The game is not fruit.
The game is essential.
For bones and humans alike, life is not just cruel and delivery.
When it seems the least appropriate thing to play, they can be the moments that it's the most urgent thing.
So the primary companies, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as we rediscovered creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible to develop a nonprofit organization called Robin Howard.
When I am not fighting poverty, I combat fire as a captain of captain in a body of voluntary weapons.
And in our city, where volunteers committed to a highly skilled staff one has to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a race to foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the captain -- I was involved in a conversation with the owner that certainly comes through one of the worst days of his life.
We were on the night night, she was standing outside the rain, under a paradox, and shown, as his house was in flames.
The other volunteer that I had just got before I was --  -- Leone Lucas Luther --  I got first to the captain and he asked him to enter and save the dog of the house.
The dog, I was "The Colomber."
There was a lawyer or a money gesture that, during the rest of his life, would have to tell people that I entered a building in calls to save a live being alive because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me an addition.
He said, "Hey, I need to be in the house.
I need to come up, add the fire, and bring it to this woman a couple of shoes.
I swear it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected, but I went out, and I went up the stairs, at the end of the hallway -- I went to the shops there at the end of that high or less they had finished to turn out the fire and entered the fourth main for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back on the staircase where I met my Nigerian and the price dog in the front door.
We took out of the house the traines for the home of the house where, as I was waiting for, their treasure.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter of the home of the home of the home with the experience demonstrated to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at about the other was that somebody had reached him even a couple of shoes.
Both in my voice in Robin Hood, as in my voice as a volunteer. I am an act of generosity of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but also of acts of grace and courage at the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved or they are for achieving remarkable levels of success, I'd like to remind you this, not wait.
They don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you now.
They serve food in a dining comedy, clean a park of the neighborhood.
They're mentally.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's lives, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they enter the game, they save the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.
Mark Benoids, Thank you.
This may seem weird -- but I'm a big fan of concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in 1948 with a very simple idea, cement modules from a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the L.A. came up with this.
He was called the automatic supercomputer locked.
And in a few years, the L.A. bricks.
It's estimated that they've made more than 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or homes.
LIGO made it accessible.
LED just adopted the concrete block of concrete in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bills labs, the next revolution was about to announce it, the new building block.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that led us from a world of aesthetic brick to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows to create much bigger and more complex circuits -- a brick at a time.
But there's a main difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't accept it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved to the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing photos.
I'm going to show you how they work.
Liberators, they're electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're ready to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they get together.
So you can't put it wrong.
Landings have a code of color.
The green is the salt, the blue is the current, the pink is the input and the orange color is the advantage.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits again.
A blue with one green produce light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a regulation.
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a international light.
We added this limb to create more impact, and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond simple play, it's actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program and connect and survive, distribute it allows us to program using very simple intuitive gestures.
To make share faster or slower to make it paralyze this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind the biomass, is that it's a growing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to reduce ready brick to use.
lights, sounds, solar panels, motors, everything must be accessible.
We've given biomass to the kids to see them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that they don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator keeps open or how an iPod responds to the touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any experience in electronics start playing with philosophers, like a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and fish, we have George creating.
(Audience metaphor."  A few weeks ago, we took distribution to the designers at Rhode Island Design School who don't have any experience in engineering, just on card, wood and paper, and we said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that they've done, an active contact channel for motion.
But wait, here comes my favorite project.
It's a local documentary local land that is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, the chest became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at the rise of all.
So, the collection, it has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and manufacture it.
We want to encourage a world of creators and inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world, is ours.
So go ahead and invent it.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seek to engage with the environment focused on the environment.
With distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
Hmm. Wait for a moment.
You can take it a little bit in charge.
We can continue to continue the video on one side.
No.
This is not.
All right.
Solar technology is ...
Oh, I am afraid of time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, an initiative to recruit the best designers and techniques to take a year and work on an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be determined, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called "The American Force, and it would be like a Peace Forest for technologies.
We selected some members every year and we put them to work with the monomary.
Instead of the Third World We send them to the wild municipal world.
They did great apps, they worked with the municipal employees.
Their task is to show the possibilities of the current technology.
You know Al Canada.
It's a story of Boston City.
This is what if you look for a quote, but what you're really looking for is someone else that someone else is clear when you're stuck in the snow because you know it's not very good at leaving fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help like this so simple?
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of "Marcus.
They were there in February, and at that time it was a lot last year.
They realized that the city never clean these stones.
But one of the members called Erik Michaels, noticed something else, that citizens cleaned up with sticks right in front of them.
So he did as any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can take a store.
You agreed to clean it when you need.
When you do that, you put a name, in this case you put it.
If you don't do, somebody can steal it.
So it has a playful component.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 proposal applications last year.
But something else that no other government technology is.
And it stretches in a viral form.
One responsible of the city of Homo in the way to see this application realized that I could use it -- not for snow, but so that citizens would take similar tasks.
It's very important to work these symbols of tsunami, but people steal the batteries out.
So I ask citizens to control them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens look at the tastes of the task.
And Chicago just launched it to make people record to clean sidewalks when neighborhood.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use.
And this has been spread with no fruits, organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology to know that this doesn't normally happen.
The general software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they've done by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the judicial power of California that even the moment has cost 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that is programmed in a couple of days and spread in a viral form is a kind of limit of warning to government institution.
It suggests to the best ways of working, not like private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Nor as a technological company, but rather like the Internet.
I mean, without restrictions in open and generation.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of government that has new generation, not as a problem of an ancient institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools so we work together with efficacy.
And it's not just "The American for America but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to civic applications every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a big frustration before that, but they don't complain about it.
And these people know something we've lost from sight.
And it is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the DM: And all of those other things that get us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in Tim Rayory, "I think we do together because we just don't can."
Now, many people have abandoned government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to acknowledge it, because things are changing.
Politics don't change, the government itself.
And because the government in the last instance of us, remember that "The People -- the people, the way to think about how to affect the change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was going to choose people to choose characters.
Well, after two years I have come to the conclusion that the government is, especially a matter of sands.
This is the center of telephone care and information.
It's the place that you call the calls if you mark 31 in the U.S.
Scott attached this call.
It involves "Star in the base of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the door of the house, put it very strong and see if it goes?
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the floors.
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has an app -- web and mobile called "The Conference Congress."
We don't program that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New Burney University of Boston.
One day, this happened really, comes up with this fish, "I said it in my battle car. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do that for shooting?
The Diamond Diamond dynamic is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In "Star Congo, it's all public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report, he said, "I took it to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
Zarkshians, yes. Video: Yes.
I went through the cube. I went home.
Good night, sweet short.
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physics.
And it's also a great example of government income to distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the technical definition of platform.
I talk about a platform so that people get carrier and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connects two people.
And I could have connected to government services of being needed, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we signed the communities.
If we call control animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people understand it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then hope that the government reflects our values and holding our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of 15 percent.
By the way there is what we call bureaucracy.
And we say that word with a lot of destruction.
But it is that desert that keeps us that that we find that we finance as something that operates in our contract, that other thing, and in consequences we're losing power.
People think politics is sensitive.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real government work occurs.
We have to collaborate with government machinery.
That makes the Islamic movement.
Have you seen them?
It's a group of conservative citizens who have written a very detailed report from 320 pages in response to the loss of the Seattle Seattle, on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's bureaucratic activism.
And for those of us who have been rescued to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see enormous challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we will get where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of all?
We can't support government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the governance function so that it can be expanded to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act much as we can act a lot, you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, and I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who's going to talk about, everybody's going to talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem they don't care very much to make their voices.
They're using the hands.
They put hands to the work to program applications that make better the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be clean up a tank, throwing weeds -- empty a garbage cube that has a chart inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned those stones and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are as digital reminder that we're not only consumers -- not only are we consumers of government that pay taxes and get services.
We're more than that, we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't fix the city.
So I want to ask all the present, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all together, will we be a volume of voices, or will we also be a huge hard."
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and in the death of death.
I've spent most of my life in marine communities, projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are said here have impact around the world.
In occasion, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I mean, I think identity is really important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if you teach them with feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, it is if it's charitable -- it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the right, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional home of an African-American family dominated by a marriage, which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, I had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She started a lot of the dictionaries in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia over 1830.
She was born on 1880 and his experience with slavery as he saw the world.
She was hard, but he was also a limb.
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, she was approaching me and he gave me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe, and then I was shown.
One or two hours later, I was going to look at me, and I was approaching me and said, "What do you still feel my audit?
And if I said no, I was glad again, and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that made you always wish to be near it.
The only problem is, I had 10 children.
My mother was the youngest of the 10.
In occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture your time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room, and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room, and I looked at me.
I thought I was a game.
And then he looked at her and he was smiling, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, he came up with the room, and he took me my hand and said, "Mr. Bride. We are going to make it."
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside, and he said, "Look, I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anybody to you."
I said, "Okay, Mark." Mark.
She said, "Now I would assume you won't do it." I said, "You know, "I said, "Oh."
Then he sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been looking at you."
And he appears, "I think you're special.
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "I want you to give me three things: Brian."
I said, "You know, Mary.
And he said, "The first thing I want you to promise is that I always want your mother."
April, "She is my heart, and you have to promise that you always care about it.
As I looked at my mom, I said, "Yes, Mars, I'll do it."
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to promise is that I'm always going to do the right thing -- although the right thing is the hard.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, Mom, I'll do it."
And then finally he said, "I think I want you to promise me is that you never have alcohol.
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, Mars, I'll do it."
I grew up in the field, in the rural South, I have a brother a year older and a sister one year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a six beer pack, I don't know where I pulled them, I grabbed my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got the crazy light lights.
He took a beer supply, offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay, you know, but I'm not going to take beer.
My brother said, "Come on today. And you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well. Take a beer.
I said, "No. Don't feel good, you can follow.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's wrong with you?" Take a beer at you?"
I kept looking at it with force and I go, "Oh, I won't be that you're still thinking about the conversation with Mars."
I said, "But what are you talking about?
He said, "Mom, you tell all the grandchildren you're special.
I was stressed.
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be widely spreading.
But I'm 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this thinking that it's a virtue, I say for the power that identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who really don't see any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother was naturally believed that all of their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been ready during the ban protection.
My aunt died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we had to get it.
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than what it was about 40 years ago.
In 1972, there were 300,000 prisoners.
There are 2.3 million.
We have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration in my opinion, it has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor or black communities, they find so much design, so much despair -- determined by these facts.
One in three black black between the 18 and the 30 years is in prison or in conditions in freedom.
In urban communities around the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, Wall women, 50 to 60 percent of all young people in color are in prison or constant freedom.
Our system is not just distributed in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a judicial system that is much better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not cooperative, but wealth.
And it seems that we feel very quiet.
The politics of fear and smoking makes us believe that these are not our problems.
We're destroyed.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some very curious development.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you get ready from right forever if you have a criminal container.
Right now in Alabama, 35 percent of the black male population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we project it over the next 10 years the level of loss of rights will be so elevated to as it was before it passed the law out of the right to the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it sentenced to 13-year-old children to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, no possibility of going out before.
Right now we're in the process of some literacy.
The only country in the world.
It represents people in the death of death.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've taught us to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the community crime?
Very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There is another way of looking at it, it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for common crimes, but if we deserve to kill them.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America defined by mistake.
In every nine people, it has identified one that is innocent and increasing from the death of death.
A error rate -- amazing, an innocent from every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation they never allowed the planes to ever be allowed if in every nine to wake up, one would be started.
But somehow we risk from the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill it.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on African-American history, I talk to you about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the reconstruction and it lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a time defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being left.
They worried about being bombard.
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who are approaching me and they say, "Mr. Stevens, you say talks -- you do speeches -- I bet the people who stop saying that in our history we first did the first time with terrorism, after 1.5 percent.
They ask me to say, "No, I say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism. Obviously, with the separation and decades of racial substance and separation.
In this country, we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we collide each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about race. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome racial separation without a commitment with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death penicion.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know it's good to listen to what you say?
April, "We don't have death in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we and intentional and deliberately, we were able to execute people?
Think about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, do you have people, especially if you were in your majority Julians?
We couldn't tolerate it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnect there.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really worry about these very difficult issues, positive and wonderful things are, however, they implemented.
We love innovation.
We are fascinated with technology. We worship creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are supporting by suffering, abuse, degradation, marine.
In my view, it needs to integrate both things.
We just talk about the need to have more hope, greater engagement, more dedicated with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the slides, which will never get to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
With innovation, development comes not only about brain ideas.
These things come from food ideas also by heart conditions.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to focus not only the brilliant and distracted, but also the dark and the hard.
Van Haiti, the great chef leader, talked about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, we had all sorts of things, we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a willingness for being in places of description and being trained?
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically in the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, it must be engaged.
There is no related disconnect with technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, exception to inequality.
Now I want to warn you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
Let's find it again.
I had the great privilege -- being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa Paris.
These women get together just to talk about.
Occasionally, Mr. Carrol called me, to say, "Look, it comes the Paris Park. We're going to get to speak.
Do you want to come and hear it?
I said, "Be lady. Yes I do."
So she said, "Well, what do you do when you come from?"
I said, "I'm going to be stuck.
So I went and I just heard them.
It was very real, very lighting.
And in an occasion, I was there, listening to these ladies, and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Paris led to me and said, "Oh, Britain, a guy who is that idea of equal justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do?
And I started giving me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question innovation.
We try to help those who have been convicted in inconsistent.
We tried to confront prejudice and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without parole.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce population in prisons.
We try to end the massive contractors.
I gave it all my best speech, and he looked at me and he said, "I am Martin my mom?
And I added and I said, "You know, it's very right?
At that point, Mrs. Sarah invented me, put her finger on her face and said, "It's why you have to be very bad."
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more valuable.
We need to find a way to tackle those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion by others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher to the worst we have made.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong, it's not a radiation.
Even if someone kills another, it is not a killer thing.
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be respected by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
So it isn't.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very dramatic, very beautiful, very lighting, very striking, it won't be judge by our technology, for our design, not by our intellectual or rational ability.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not the way they treat the rich, powerful and privileged people, but by the way they treat the poor, the confidence, the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
And I feel discussing. I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
I'm tired, like all.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my reasoning in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been sensitive with a lot of direction.
I go to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, which have been skills for them to do it as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone in what it is?
The judge was taking it as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night was waking up thinking, by God, if the judge can become something that you are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, Brian, the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a movement.
I had a 14-year-old client -- a tiny, poor, black.
I started working on the move, with an embrace that said, "Marcus so that my 14 year-old black client is treated as a 757 year-old private white white white white white white white.
In the move, I put it into the model of the activity, in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a line attached about how in this country there is no ethic but a whole lack of ethics.
In the next morning, I woke up thinking about that integrated movement would be a dream.
For my horror -- not only had it reduced, but he had sent her to the cut.
About two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally I decided, oh God, I have to go to the court for this stupid case.
I went up to the car and felt really slightly, overwhelmed.
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and penis.
I finally got away from the car. I walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with an older black man, was the set of the judge.
And when he looked at me, he came up to me, and he said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a lawyer. He said, "It's a submit? I said yes.
So I get care of me and open me.
And I was suspended in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of you."
I have to tell you now that that was visible.
That was deeply connected to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I entered the audience room.
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you write this motion motion?
I said, "Yes, Mr. I went to me, and we started to discuss it.
People started to go. They were all informed.
I was the one who had written those crazy ones.
They came up with the police fiscal polices, the currents.
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all of us are going to talk about race because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the radiation of the eye I went to see how he was going and came.
And I looked at the window and I went to hear all that screen.
I kept walking for here and there.
Finally, this old black, with a concern face, entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table table.
About 10 minutes later, the judge is demanding a recession.
During the break, he was supposed to be obed because he had entered the room.
The assistant.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the audience of the audience?
And the old black guy stood up and he looked at the assistant. He looked at me and he said, "Come on this room of audience to tell this young man who kept his view in the goal with shame?
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We can't really be truly human if we don't worry about human rights and dignity.
Our survival is linked to each other.
That our views of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must lead to fractions, compassion and justice.
And above all, those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that they keep the view in the goal with finished.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You just heard and seeing a wish of the audience, of this community, to help in your own purposes.
Something that is not a charge. What can we do?
BC: There are several opportunities close there.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a reference to this spring, where you will make an effort to restore the funds that are spending today in punishment policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years, billion dollars.
And despite this, the 46 percent of the homes of hospital don't conclude in arrangements.
55 percent of the rapes are not coming to anything.
Here's an opportunity for change.
And this reference is going to propose that these funds are going to be destroyed to get the law, to security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in criminal in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation is said that it has to do with the largest incarceration rate.
What would you say to those who think that is?
BC: Actually, the rate of crime with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growing growth in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase is in the heart population.
And we let us convince the punishment of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to perpetual chain, to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property instead of making them give those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of crime and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment doesn't do anything for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: Britain, you've been excited about being here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Peter Diamond." These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months -- that could be the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that press media prefer to provide negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second day our senses get a lot more data than the brain is likely to process.
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is a former fragment of the temporal lobe called ambition.
American is our early warning detector -- the danger detector.
I offered and record all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So this is why of a dozen stories we would rather look at the negative.
That old one comes out of the press, "If there are blood, he says, it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news seven days in the week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising that we are perfections.
It's not surprising that people think that the world goes wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get distributed.
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century for a series of forces is accelerating so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, species extinction -- water scarcity and energy, certainly we have them.
As human beings are very good at adding the problems and in the long run, we end up with them.
We analyzed it in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has more than doubled, average income per capita income has been transported around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food and electricity, transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kenya that global literacy went from 25 percent to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we keep putting higher and higher expectations.
In fact, we redefined the meaning of poverty.
Think about it, today in America, most of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, blocks, refrigerators television, mobile air conditioning and cars.
The holy magnets of the car of the past century, the experts on the planet, would never have dreamed of such luxury.
Support a lot of this is technology and lately its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that shows in information technology jumped in this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling price performance in about 12 to 24 months.
And so the mobile cell phone that you have in the pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, how soft it is, in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession and depression and outside.
It's the quick computer result used to build faster computers.
None of the big challenges.
And even though it's gratitude on a law on the left, it's going up to the top.
The growth rate of technology is its increasingly fast.
And in this curve, the tons of Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends from Australia call infinite computing and sensors, and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuels -- vaccines and food, the digital medicine, the nanomatic and the A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" of Watson of Washington?
It was pick.
I looked at the newspapers the best headline that they had.
And I loved this one: "I sold to human opponents."
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
I play with the matrix of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called Symmetric University.
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how they can use to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to take a company, or a product or service, which can possibly affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would be absurd.
Today we can point out a dozen companies that have already done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating life for each of the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that which is scarce, and it's going to be abstract.
You see, scarcity is contextual and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
This is a story from Navigato Milky March in the middle of 1800.
He's the guy on the left.
I invited the king of Stanford.
Narrator troops ate with silver, and the same Nancua, with gold covered with gold.
But the king of Steel, I ate with aluminum eggs.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, and more than the gold and the platform.
That's why the tip of the monument to Washington is aluminum for aluminum here.
You see, even though aluminum is eight percent of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal metal.
It's ready by oxygen and silences.
But then the electron came up and made of the aluminum something so cheap that we used it as it was disappearing.
We produce this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that is about 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 electronics of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about scan, but accessible.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the people of the game, 8,000 rupees, versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy was 50 last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the sunny parts of the United States, solar electricity cost six cents a kilometer per hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have an abundance of energy we also have autonomous water.
We talk about the wars for water.
Remember when Carl Saudi pointed out the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after Saturn happened.
So I took a famous picture. How did it call?
"A pale blue dot.
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered by 70 percent of water.
Yes, the 97 percent, it's water water, two percent is ice, and we fight by the 1800s of the water on the planet, but also here is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology comes from the nanotubes.
In a conversation with Dean Karajan this morning, one of the innovative innovators of the grass, I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to do it, his technology called Street -- the knowledge is the size of a small refrigerator.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of water on the day of any source tape -- contact water, a letter, for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just agreed to make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have a confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in the world of 200 countries on the planet.
This is a potential innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world by the end of 2013.
Think about it, that mass warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya than President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- HIV video, images, books of books and music, and medical diagnostic technology, now they are definitely destroyed and losing market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to do is when it comes to health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announcing with the Foundation, and something called the X Washington Prize Thailand, 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to combine these technologies in a mobile device that they talk, and because it has A.I. -- you can get it, you can extract blood from the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the mortality charge is 25 percent, and there's 1.3 percent of the health workers.
When this device sequence a virus of RNA or DNA that I don't recognize -- call the health care and, first of all, prevent the pandemic happening.
But this is the biggest force to produce an abundance world.
I call it the billion dollars.
The white lines here are the population.
We just spent the brand of the seven billion billion.
By the way, the best protection against demographic explosion is to address the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds before you have been joined to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What do you want to do?
And instead of an economic collapse, we will have the largest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars injected in the global economy.
And they will take more health from the Trickle of a better education with Academy Khan and because of the use of 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What are three billion more members of humanity, healthy health and productive healthcare?
How about a few voices never before?
What if we give the oppressed. Where they are, a voice to be heard and can act for the first time?
What would these 3,000 million things?
And if they're contributions that we can't predict it?
Something that I learned with the X Prize is that you teams small, guided for your passion with a goal, you can do extraordinary things, things that you could only do the big corporations and the governments.
I'm going to end sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you may know.
It's called Facebook.
I came up at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way that protein is.
The folds determine structure and functional.
It's something very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of supermarkets.
They've played with this college teachers, each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people were supporting and started playing.
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by putting proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that today we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the grade industry.
We have the capital capital.
And we have three billion new minds that are getting us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very small idea?
It's the driver of the game point.
And as the idea can explain in a minute, I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin. One of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in 1886.
You might think it would be perspective, but it wasn't like that.
I actually collect fish.
And I described one of them as a very "build."
It was the benefic.
It was done so much to the 1880s.
Now the fish is at the Rio Red List.
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have any special stuff.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're private.
The forests still say they remain intact.
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept, the contract of the waist.
Because I was there in 1973, studying a standard in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe, and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could integrate it.
I was very burned with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The letter was surrounded by patterns, and as you can see, a few hands.
There were the talents of about 20 cents, the black ship.
And the fishing of this tissue was very abundant and it was going for a good moment, so it was more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had declined half.
They were made at five feet.
He experienced a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
It is, nothing to change, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was involved in the introduction of the fish fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, it started in the 1960s, Europe made a lot of development projects.
The fishing development would impose the countries that already had 100,000 fish fisheries, impossible industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty ugly -- was called the Monday four.
I went out fishing in it, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea, and especially in the Sea Sea.
What we captured was something instrumental.
You know, I now know, the bottom of the sea.
90 percent of what we captured were speed, other animals that are at the bottom.
And most fish are tiny management on a few remains, remains that are coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the cover and then it was removed.
These images are extraordinary, because transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The background is going to be a solid coral board, in this case, to be a location.
This is a dead tourist.
They didn't eat them. They were dense because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not drowning yet.
So they wanted to kill because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen pick up every time you go to an area where you've never fish.
But it's not a document.
We will transform the world, but we don't remember it.
We adjust the point of partner, the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you generalize this happens something like this.
On the axis and we have good things -- biodiversity things, the vertical of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with nature.
Each generation will use the images to start at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extract it forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they didn't perceive the loss that happened.
You can analyze the survival of changes.
And at the end of the end keep a little bit of missions.
And that, in large measure, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that no longer are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when the predatory societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very abundant, before you get extinct -- it's unlikely frequent.
You don't lose abundant animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea range of big fish.
They become a little bit frequent because we fish them.
Over time there's a few fish, but we think that's the point of party.
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, questioned it was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way is not the way they expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you would say, like captain and so many fish in this area can't be used or generally don't use the scientists of fish because it's not "slip."
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we live in institutional societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can take a protected marine zone.
Because with the protected marine areas, we really picked the past.
We remember the past that people can't conceive because the game point has been running and it's quite low.
That's for the people who can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that provides, which allows them to erase their party point.
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the Middle West people for example?
I think the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a Simple Bay simulation.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in Charles Bay, 500 years ago.
And you'll have noticed that the margins and the tools are like "The "Looking:
And if you think about "Starry, if you think about why people get stuck with the movie -- and talk about the story of Portuguese, why do they connect with the images?
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has lost.
So my recommendation -- the only one who will give, is Cambridge, doing "Star OITE: underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin Australia, the YouTube trend manager -- and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we will see why the videos are making viruses and how important it is.
We all want to be stars, celebrity, singers, comments, when I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, is a part of our global culture.
Anybody can get famous on the Internet in a search.
It takes over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minutes.
And of those, just a small percentage is making viral increase, and it gets infinite and makes cultural limbs.
How does that happen?
Three things: the trends of trends and participation communities and surprise factor.
Okay, let's start with.
Bear Vietnamese? Oh my God, my God.
God.
Wow.
Oh, wow, business?
KA: Last year, Bernard Volvan published this film shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the reproductions in the popular rise of the past summer.
Behavior doesn't make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a piece of a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Voice Mountain Beach.
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy Kiminer.
Jimmy Kiribati published this guy who caused the popular video.
The trends of trends like Jimmy Kim presented us and interesting things and engaged them into a wider audience.
Red Black,  It's Friday, versus. You have to start the Friday --   Everybody wants to go on the weekend.   KA: Virally, Friday, starting the Friday --  KA: Don't think we could have this conversation without talking about this video.
"The "God Revolution is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like "The Grand Standard, this video seemed to have emerged from nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask them for those other pieces, they're also Friday, too.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday versus?
Well, I took the Talk Tasmania, and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. Nelson from Mister Steven Theater was one of the first people to make a joke on the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of trend creators will adopt a point of view and share it with a broader audience, accelerate the process.
So, this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 parasites in YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the endless entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the phenomenon -- or do something new with that.
"The Canada, it's a repetitive animation with a music clothes.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three hours that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is creativity I woke up between the Internet technology community.
There was remote.
Somebody did a version of the old.
And then he became international.
Suddenly, I came up with a whole community of remove that made this happen from being a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today we don't just enjoy it, we participate.
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted "The French drawing, or Red Black or "The Cal."
What a script could have written that I would consider this situation?
In a world in which two days of video per minute, only that really unique and unexpected can get rid of the way that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to look at this great video of a guy who protest against the cups in New York, I admit that I don't care too much.
Casey Niniturum, I would lie for the biological biologist, but there are often obstacles that are going to be shared by the biological biomass.
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect and his humor, Casey Nicholas made five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads us to a big question.
Bear Valuens, what does this mean?
Oh.
KA: What does this mean?
The trend creators -- creative communities, the totally unexpected, are features of a new kind of media -- of a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience that defines the popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities in the world, Justin Big, started on YouTube.
They don't ask permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're just the current media -- but they define the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a finished story.
It's a puzzle that is still laughing.
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first piece, a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a playwright, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique unit of unit and freedom of his country.
Imagine as the communist comes in Santa, and they were facing the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much of the friends, now the burning thing.
It was reproduced in silence.
He died for the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in vain. And my lesson was to learn that the story tried to fly it, but we supported it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat when it looks like the display depressed to the sea.
My mother, Mars, was only 18 years old when her father died, and a conventional marriage and two small girls.
For her, life had been destined to a used task, the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was incredibly incredibly for her that I couldn't get it.
And after a four year-old spring that defies the fiction, a boat goes down to the losses of fishing boat.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the picks, the rape and the death.
Like most adults, my mother took a drug with poison.
If we were captured, we first took my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine -- it comes back into each wave and the vast horizontal horizon.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were angry with the wooden of men in our boat, or the engine died and couldn't go for six hours.
But I know I remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to end the journey was too much for him, and the first apple I tried, given by the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee field, we discovered in Melboxima.
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in Monterey, a sub-Saharan class suburban whose population is composed of immigrants of immigration.
Unlike the average class suburbs -- whose existence was discovered, in Monterey, had no sense of the right.
The smells that come from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the English fragments were interviewed between the people who had one thing in common, they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
And yet, I found time to study English and get a title on you.
We were poor.
Every dollar were associated, and established an extra pipe in English and mathematics, it doesn't matter what was supposed to take off, that it was generally new clothes, it was always from second hand.
Two media pairs for school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the tons, because it had to last six years.
And there were rare strings and painful pains about the barriers and some graffiti -- "The "Looks, you go home.
Home, where?
Something in me is excuse.
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to get you."
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.
My mother was extracted every night, but we went over our day, and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother suffered personalized, all of the boat.
And my task was to be waking up until their nightmares started to be able to wake up.
She opened a computer store, then he studied to be a little bit of a star and opened another business.
And women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry.
They were looking for subsidies and paralyzed.
They created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic Asian student.
In the other, I was embedded in precise lives, tragic limited by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many people get help over the years.
And for that work, when I studied my last year of lawyer, they chose me the young Australian young year.
And I was catalyzed from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but his edges didn't fit.
As Le an anonymous resident of Monterey, it was now so Losi, refugee and social activists invited to speak in places that had never heard of name, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the prototypes.
I didn't know how to use the covers.
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to take the routine to the routine and the journey of life in an island sub-Saharan -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ended up the day as they did for almost 20 years, telling me about the day of each one and standing asleep, the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age that she had when she went to the boat.
The "I never had a choice.
"A "Man: "I said, "and you don't know what you're not."
So I talked about juvenile and education and despair and management and ends.
And the more frankly, the more I was talking about it to talk more.
I met people from all walks of life, many of them doing what they love, living in the border of possible.
And even though I ended up my license. I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger -- a recent arrived, new on the scene -- and not only it's okay, but it's something that I'm going to be grateful, maybe a gift of the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean hanging the horizon, it can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your provider.
I gave the enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is gone, but not the way we fear about.
The possibilities that were not allowed to be allowed to be a tremendous deal.
There was an energy there, a recording optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and walking.
So I kept my intuition.
I put together a small group of people for who the slogan can't do -- it was an irresistible challenge.
For a year we didn't have a penny for a year.
At the end of every day, I was doing a giant pile of soup that we all share.
We worked at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant ones, and we opened up step.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My corals again.
Three months later, I had moved to me, and the adventure continued.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the Constitution was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was created.
At the age of 17, it became a configuration of a Mandarin whose mother was going to beat it.
No support of his husband, he caused a return to the defense and bringing the cause herself and much more cheap when he won.
He can't make it struggling.
I was in the shower in the room of a hotel in Sydney when she died, 1,000 miles in Melboxima.
I looked through the shower of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to wake up.
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in Montana and sat around her attack.
We told the stories and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monkey came and told us that he had to close the attack.
My mother asked us to feel his hand.
I asked the monkey, "Why is your hand hot, and the rest of the body so cold.
"Because you've taken your hand in the morning, he said.
Don't have soldiers.
If there's a nerve in our family, that email through women.
Given who we were and how life formed, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have frustrated.
The defeat.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I ask myself about the boat.
Who could want that to you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
Can I give you a place in your lives, fly down in every wave, the constant pace of the engine, the vast hormone that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see it to jump, I would do.
Translation Neillas, and also the mother of so is here today in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story begins in Radio about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the star sky -- Muran Al surgeon.
We were thinking about how nothing has changed since the age of the ancient Indian elegance in "The Market."
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a cart and we would shake the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And at that time when Audience: the great Indian warrior pressure, had a bow -- he took a bow.
We now do the same with tapesters and machines.
The conclusion we had was that the machinery had replaced magic.
And that blew me a lot.
I felt a little bit more technical.
I was terrified of this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a career if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic -- not killing magic.
And my grandfather gave me his hair plate of pocket.
And this technology piece of 50 years was for me the most magical thing.
It became a door door to a world full of images and pickles and nationalism in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones, luxury clocks and cameras are supposed to be.
So I started our inspiration.
And so I wash up to this technology world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than killing magic.
illustrate books since I was 16.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a storytelling device able to connect to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are we?
They play the text with the image, the animation, the sound and the touch.
Narrative becomes increasingly multiplication.
But what does that mean?
I'm about to launch Keep -- an interactive app for iPad.
It says, "Cancer your fingers on every light."
And so   He says, "This box is something like? I wrote my name.
And so I turned a character from the book.
And in several times, I got a letter -- the iPad knows where I live thanks to the GPS -- that comes lead to me.
My inner girl gets excited with all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magical and dragons, but to that magic of childhood to those ideas that we open from children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar was always excited to me.
So over here, we have to invent the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, lighting your path in what it remains from the book.
Another idea that fascinated me of a girl was that a whole galaxy in a square.
So here, every book and every world is transformed into a little bit that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book there has always been maps, but they've been static maps.
This is a map that grows up, philosophy and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book, it also reveals up.
I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary content.
These are the applications.
We've all heard of the events and the nine, but how many people outside India know their Indian controls, the applications?
These poor vessels have been trapped in the cameras of India for millennia, in an old and high book.
So we're bringing them back into a contemporary childhood story.
In a story that deals today as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been locked down, pasted to their Egyptians, haven't got to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where you have to go out to the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of collections -- of pages, football, shoes, burns and contracts.
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, take a picture to a flower and then tag it.
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then tag it.
So you create a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a store and says, "Oh, today I saw a break?
A child in India says, "I've seen a monkey?
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taken out.
In the connections of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book, we tend to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad, and the video goes up and through augmented reality sees a group of animated caves that appear on the inner plants of the house.
In a moment, the screen is filled with leaves of leaves.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and use them to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where nature forces are trained with technology and magic and technology approaching each other.
We will take the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of professors fail.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about it is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the Radio University was to go to a director of the listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she took a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and known, what happens?
"How can we help it."
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone, or maybe not everyone, but most of the failure projects fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi.
It has a person to turn it off.
Every morning I get up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 kilograms to me.
But it's so simple, that every time I connect me, I send my information to Google Heart.
And my medical doctor has access to him too. So he can see what my weight problem, not at the same time that I need heart assistance or some urgency of that style but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connected to my Wi-Fi capital, and before I went to my car, people start talking, Luciva, today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the peers used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can start to move people out of their chairs and together develop some recreational activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week being available.
This little bank connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people can, from their homes, take their blood pressure, send them to their doctor, and share them with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they will recover control and to be captured from their own boat, but it can also help us care about health because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of measuring attention, the doubling of demand and other issues.
They do techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by creative.
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video.
We all have narrative control in cars.
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the automatic cartoons in Mars.
Also where all the gas gas.
And of course, we can find fast food chain.
But where is the nearest Delhi to help this patient?
We asked, but nobody did.
Nobody knew where to get the DNA saved lives right now.
What we did was we do critics in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to, you see a DNA, please. Give them where, and when it's open, because sometimes I open up in office hours and others are closed.
And over 10,000 Delhi are already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an iPhone application.
We created an app for Leonardo, augmented reality, to find these Delevey.
And every time you're in the city of Mars and somebody else, you can use your iPhone, and the next weeks use your Microsoft cell phone to find the nearest Delhi, which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like Delhi 46, which is the name of the product, but also like DNA.
And we wanted to start globally.
We're bringing all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work and act like a center for the Chaping Christians around the world.
Every time they are in vacation and somebody else, it can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us value these Delhi.
They could be a message service or people of television -- for example, to see if the DNA that shows is still in its place.
Please get in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share my photograph.
Or is it "The photograph?
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest for photography woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
It was mixed with my previous passion on the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was on planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you press the public.
For me, photography had more than to do with being in the right place, at the very moment.
I thought anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when you press the public.
Pictures like this, a construction in a very transparent road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of reality.
Or pictures like this, dark and colorful at a time, but with the common goal of keeping the level of reality.
And when I say reality I say photographs.
Because, of course, it's not something that I can capture but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
Pictures where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them seem real?"
Is it the details or the colors?
Do you invest light?
What creates the illusion.
Sometimes illusion is perspective.
But at the end it is about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive in a two-dimensional surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality, and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
So here we have three other objects imagine -- something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still seems three-dimensional as if you exist.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So we go to the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it really makes no sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It really consists to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic I think are that we don't even think, the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But by combining pictures is very important to consider, because otherwise something is going wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But combined, you can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the combined pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images hit these requirements -- they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the principle and end of different images with a perfect joint.
It has to be impossible to see where the image is made.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is manipulation.
But this image is totally composed by photographs of different places.
The personal I think it's easier to create a place that will find because you don't need to put the ideas that you have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew that I had several months to plan it, to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The costs are a different location.
The underwater part was captured in a stone pile.
And yes, I even made the house out of the top of the island to look more solid.
So in order to get a realistic result of it, I think it takes planning.
You always start with a boat, an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well thinking.
If you do a good job by taking the pictures, the result can be very beautiful, and it can be very real.
All the tools are there, and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can put it on?
It's a diagram that I took from a cartoon to me.
I don't care so much to show you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of Rio microbes versus the power of local areas.
The interesting thing about this is that this is like a lot of other we used to see, it's kind of a straight line on a logarithmic scale.
In other words, every step here represents a magnitude order on the performance scale.
Speaking of technology with self-interest is a novel thing.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights.
I need more intensity because I write about paper.
Why do we draw technological curves in local scales.
The answer is that if you draw them in a normal curve in which we say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to grade, the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a self-assembled curve would be very dumb -- we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a qualitative change.
If the transportation technology will move as fast as microbes, spent tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But they don't go through that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of a renewable growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to do is look at these exponential curves -- we see that they don't go forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve I know as this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we're in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask -- and ask me, what is that new way that I adopt the world?
What does the world look like?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we're embedded in it.
I remember the future in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has found, year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel like something is happening.
We can feel it.
And we know it doesn't make a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extracting what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about what it might be, how it could be that transition that we experience about.
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at things in the long term.
The time scale I would like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So we went back to about 2.5 million years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with many chemicals around us.
If we look at the way that chemicals are organized we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA with RNA -- I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that at the time, I had floating some oil bombs with all kinds of chemical recipes in its inside.
Some of those oil droplet sets a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside, and so the drops grew up.
And they started to split it.
In a sense, those were the most primitive cell forms, those oil bombs.
But those legs were not alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they divide up increased, an unequal distribution of the chemicals that they continue.
That's why every score was a little different.
In fact, the legs that somehow differ to be better at the time to incorporate food chemicals up, grow more, increase more chemicals and split more.
They usually lived longer, they were more representation.
It was a form of life, chemical life, very simple, but things got interesting when these droplets learned the trick.
In some ways we don't understand very well these bombs learned how to store information.
They learned to get information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, they were involved in this evolutionary evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to replicate it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for fun -- now we can write things with this code.
So here I have 100 white dust members that I try to hide with the security people of the airport.
But contains. The code has the common letters that we used to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this DNA fragment and 10 at 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot for all the present, in fact, for every person in the world, and it's here.
If it was an elevator that would have put it in a virus and would have spread it through the room.
What was the next step?
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy.
But then another big step in which things were very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming information in cells of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, they evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and caught them to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave us to form communities that, in a way, were together in that, and set up a symbol.
So they will survive or fail together, or that if a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community were more likely to be profitable for evolution.
And the point of inflection happened when these communities were approaching so much that, in fact, they got together and decided to write the entire community recipe together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have multicellular communities, communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a multi-the-shoulder community.
We have many cells that are no longer acting alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call an organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to add information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than processing information in community.
They're the neural structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they began to specialize within the community being the responsible structures to record and understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as individuals, learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn how to don't eat some fruit because I knew bad and sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that have evolved to have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system building those information structures enormously accelerate the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now occur confined to an individual.
It could happen in time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most refined version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a vague idea, in my head.
I'm here sitting up to a little bit of graphics, and hopefully building a similar idea, empty and confused, in his heads that I carry some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound sequences and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as a humanity, we've started to make abstractions.
We now go through similar periods to the multicellular organisms, we abstract our methods of record, presentation and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The telescope, computing -- video tape, Craig, etc. are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And that connects us into something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microscopes.
You saw the evolutionary energy of you in which you produced some evolution with the Congoline program, before your eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the story I told you took a billion years each.
The next steps, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years old.
The next ones, the language etc., took less than a million years.
And the next ones, like electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is retreated, I guess it's the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this exploration of the curve.
We see the process retracted.
But I made my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that I job for designers would not be possible without recent computer advances.
But now I design such a complex objects that would be impossible to me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that connections machine.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of Treaty Machines, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine, and the machine with that does something that you could not be able to get far faster and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they employ methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microbes.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, can you run a hundred million sequences of instructions to the random?
Could you run these sequences of instructions at random and take all those programs together, and take those who are more aware of what we want to do?
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that get closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, ordered numbers, so none of them did it.
But one luckily, luckily, I could put two numbers on the right order.
And I said, "You could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the task?
We want those and we eliminate the rest.
And now we will play the best of the numbers.
And we will be able to reproduce them following a protection process to sex.
We take two programs that will get children, which will be surrounded by subsidies, and that children inherit the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the programs of programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the process.
It is again.
I introduced some mutations together.
And try and try again with another generation.
Well, each generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that ordered numbers in absolutely perfect ways.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
They are dark programs, strangers.
But it turns the comet.
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depended on.
He was once in a 747 with Martin Minister, and he pulled a card and says, "Look this.
He says, "This plane has hundreds of thousands of particles who work together to offer a safe flight, doesn't make you feel crowd?
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot faster and so we can run these programs much further quickly.
I mean, it's retracted.
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so confused.
Because all these technologies are reduced.
We're awake.
And we're at an analog moment to the single-celled organisms when they become multiplication.
We are the friends and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we're all part of the creation of whatever it comes to be.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I was eliminating.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that should change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I have chosen enough time to allow me to make part of my false press in that.
Before treating the theme of my talk, we talk about baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end of the World series.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's to go out "The rules, talk about statistics and use it to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them, and I hope many of you know it.
It's called the battle average.
And we talked about 300 percent of a string that kills 300 percent.
That means that battery battle expensive, three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being caught -- and anyone who tries to launch to the first base, don't get in time, and the second base will be saved.
Three attempts of 10.
You know how to call a 300-dollar salary in the Great Libra?
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how to call a 400 baseball battle."
By the way, that's somebody who was 10 beats -- accelerating four.
Legacle, like the Lest Williams legacy, the last player of the Great League of Bill in order to execute more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now we take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or perhaps less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose they have applications and they are streaming into a surgeon that has also a record of 400 in adversity.
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a stop place and a loved self has two closed curiosity arteries and his family doctor gives him to a cardiologist whose record in anthropologists is 200 percent.
But you know something?
She's getting this year.
And their access have been 256.
This is not working.
But they ask them?
What do you think you should be the average accident of a heart surgeon or an orthopedic surgeon of a nurse or a gentleman of a gentleman:
100,000 very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the whole medicine knows the speeds of a good surgeon, a doctor or paralyzed.
What we do, though, is to send them to the world, and I get included, with the maneuver of being perfect.
That never -- never -- make a mistake and worry about finding out how to do it well.
That was the message that I did when I was in medical school.
I was an obsessed observation student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Gold studied to a blood test.
Like that.
I studied in my little desert, in the nurses of the General Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my analog class, I memorized the origin and the muscle work, the branching of every artery that comes out of the car, the diagnostic and the distributed difference and the non-virus.
And I even knew the difference of the difference about how to classify the curved accountability.
And as much as they accumulate more and more knowledge.
And I was very well, I graduated with honor.
And you get away from medical school with the impression that if you memorize everything, then it would know everything, or the most possible thing, close to the whole thing, because that's what I was shocked from mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mr. Stringdon.
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought up the Law September to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the cardiac service.
And when I was able to ask a cartoon to meet a cardiologist I got to attend to that patient.
And they report to the boss of resistance.
When I saw Mrs. Strahborando lady was ship.
I heard a restriction sound.
And when the authority listened to a string sound on both sides, what I was inspired by a frozen heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pumping the blood forward, the blood goes to lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to diagnose it.
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I would give him.
I gave him aspiration and medication to relieve pressure in his heart.
I gave it dinosaurs, water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And there it was when he made the first mistake, he sent her home.
They actually eat two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the boss of residents.
I didn't get up the phone, and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and I would ask him to see it.
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to take a little bit of fun information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that would require constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take responsibility, that I could take care of my patients without even telling my boss either.
The second mistake that they made was worse.
When I send her home, I don't pay attention to a voice in my interior that he said, "And it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure that until I asked the nurse to take care of Mr. School sheet, "Do you know it's okay if you go home.
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total nature, "Yes, I think I'll be OK."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed up the high, and the ambulance along with the parasites took her home.
And I went back to the hospital room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad introduction in the stomach.
But with my job.
At the end of the day, I was empathy to leave the hospital and walk into parking parking where my car was to go home. At that time, I did something that I don't normally do.
I went through the emergency service of the way home.
And there another nurse, not the one that would take care of the Saudi lady before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency emergency medical doctors.
Other specialists also fear them, but there is a particular in excuse and is that we see the fascinating patients.
The three words are. Do you remember it?
"Do you remember the patient who sent your home?"
I asked the other nurse with total nature.
"You come back, with the same voice tone.
She was fine.
But I went back to the edge of death.
By an hour of having reached his house, after I gave him the high, he suffered a collapse and his family called the 911, the parasites brought it to emergency with an organic pressure of 50 feet from History, which means a severe shock.
It was just breathing and blue.
The emergency staff goes through all its resources.
They gave him medication to climb the blood pressure.
And they put him an artificial breath.
I was confident and drawn to the spinal cord.
He had a mixture of feelings because then he was in the intensive therapy and waiting for every hope he would recover.
And in the two or three days it was obvious that they never wake up.
He had a released brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they resisted what was happening.
And in the ninth day, you let it go. The lady Shakespeare, spouse, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The next weeks, I was punished by it and experiment for the first time the shame of shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, isolated without feeling that shame of healthy because you can't talk to your colleagues.
You make the parents, and you never eat that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
The marine shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt like that.
And it wasn't for my boss, he was a love.
I talked to the family, and I'm sure that I would take things out and make sure that they didn't get me.
And I kept asking those questions.
Why didn't I ask my board, why did I send it to your house?
And in my worst moments, why did I eat a mistake so touch?
Why medicine.
And slowly that feeling was disappeared.
And I began to feel better.
And in a cool day, the sky opened up and finally came out the sun and asked me if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with myself in which if I was able to cut the efforts to be perfect to not commit more mistakes -- I would make these voices.
And it was.
I went back to work.
But it will happen.
Two years later, I was help in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I received a 25 year-old man with a pain in the board.
I was very busy and standing up.
He pointed out here.
I looked at his throat -- he was a little bit colonized.
He prescribed penicillin and sent her home.
But as he turned to the door, he kept pointing his throat.
Two days later, when I came to make my guard change, my boss asked me to talk to me in his office.
And I proposed the three words: Do you remember you?
Remember the patient he saw for a pain in the board?
He came back and he didn't have a strategic humility.
He had potentially deadly affect called electronics.
You can look at Google -- it's an infection, not the grave, but the upper aerial game, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He was lucky -- they don't fail.
It was administered by anti-based antibiotics and recovered at a few days.
And they went through the same period of shame and representation, and then I got up and I went back to work, until again and again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of emergency properties, not applications.
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it goes to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a discovered.
One of them thought I had a kidney calculation.
I ordered a radiation X-ray -- but it turned out normal. A colleague that was restored to the patient perceived a certain sensitivity in the lower right and called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid for removed and asked my colleague to check it.
They checked it up, and by noticing a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand square, called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every case, I was striking to me.
But I'd like to tell you that they eat the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a park.
The most significant people have been over the last five years.
Just embarrassed and no support.
And here's the problem, if I can't release and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the voice that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my colleagues.
How do you teach them this so they don't eat the same mistakes?
If I go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure.
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but they don't listen to somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a training in my hospital loved the wrong leg -- believe it would have difficulty in looking at the eyes.
This is the system we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two positions -- those who are eating mistakes and those who are not, who can't sleep and the ones that know, the ones who have a result and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like an ideological reaction, as an antibody who starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we look at medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about distribution and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical professional and medical errors to learn what possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto, to my program, "Come Court, Black Arabic.
And what I learned is that errors are ubiquitous.
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 prescribed drugs in the hospital are wrong, or the distribution is not right -- in a system where the unconscious infections are increasingly more, and more numerous -- causing chaos and death.
In this country, 24,000 categories are killed by everyday medical mistakes.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's about responsibilities, boreals, because we're not discovering the problem as we should.
And that's how things are.
A hospital system where knowledge is going to multiply every two or three years, and we don't update us.
The propeller of sleep invaded everything.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient in the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, come home with legal eyes, and with all of a sudden, and all of a sudden, my story is about advanced.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a robot, I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't reduce their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as they taught us, and we eliminate all of the professional professionals to error, well, they won't stay any other.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their most gravity.
In my program, "Penny white art, it's a custom to say, "This is my worst error? I would say to everybody, from the parasites to the head of heart surgery -- "This is my worst mistake, blah, blah, blah, "Looks are your errors? And you drive the microphone to them.
And their students will stop, go back and get your head and try and start telling your stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You want to say, "Look, you don't eat the same error?
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a representative medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The rebel doctor is human, you know human, you accept it, and you don't have any of your mistakes, but it is effort to learn from what happened to teach others.
They share their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
It pointed out the mistakes of other people not with the intention of catching them, but in a kind of loving and support way for everybody to benefit.
And I work in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings play the system, and when this happens, they commit errors from time to when it happens.
My name is Brian Gold.
I'm a representative doctor.
I'm human, I eat mistakes.
And I feel a lot, but I am effort to learn something that I can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three personal words, I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take one day anything?
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey of over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that say to pick a half a half -- it's about 70 a day.
Not a lot ago, in a research followed for a week to a group of companies of businesses.
The researchers recorded the different tasks for these executives and the time they started making decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, they took 119 jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included a lot of ministers.
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent would require an hour or more of its time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many of the category of nine minutes, and how many of you in an hour?
How do you calculate the way those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the current problem, choose to be able to pick up the survey of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions, and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please have a paper.
And now my first question of the day, are you ready to hear about the problem of choice survivor?
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, frequently this very high supermarket supermarket, at least at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It's called Dragons.
It was almost like going to a amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and lived, more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the bottled water, and this was when we take water from the graph.
I loved going to that store, but in an occasion, I asked me, why would I never buy anything."
This is the station of the olive oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in the box that came from military trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, "Would you okay this strategy of offering all these choices?
He pointed out of the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment. This is the state.
Palay.
They had 360 different classes.
We installed a painting for definitely, right to the entrance of the store.
We put up there sixth substances, or 24 different flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop testing the message?
More people stopped when there were 24, 60 percent, when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a metal track.
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of the ones that stopped when there were 24 percent, only three percent came to buy memorial.
Of the ones that I paid when there were six, we saw that 30 percent of the bought bought memory.
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy members if they found six, which if they found 24.
Well, deciding that we don't buy miracle -- we probably convinced us, and it's less good to bring the line, but it turns out that the problem of the choice of choice affects us in very momentous decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this doesn't get us.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe a study I did with Gordon Humble, entrepreneurs Karla Karajad and Web Jane, where we look at decisions about savings for the retirement of a million Americans in between a million plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funding supply available on support plans for retirement.
And we found out that there was actually a correlation there.
We had 650 plans that were going from two to 58 different options.
We found that the bigger number of funding was offered -- there was less participation.
So if we look at the extremes -- we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the participation rate was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation will go down to the 60 percent.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those of you who decided to participate, the bigger number of choice, the more people were unable to avoid actions or the hedge funds.
As soon as there was more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we will rebuild to optimize future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative implications by offering more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that they make the decision, the app even when this goes against the interest itself.
It's more likely to make the worst decisions, in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less satisfying -- although obviously they go better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that gigantic variety of most of them, mustard and wine and memory, but we are not able to do the calculations to compare it, contrast and choose from that incredible exhibition.
Today I want to propose to you four simple techniques that we've tried, in a way or another, in different research, so that they can engage in their business.
The first is: Chris.
You've heard it before, but it's never been more than today, which is less than more.
People always bother when I say, "Allegal."
They care about losing space in the analog.
But actually, what we're seeing getting more and more is that if you decide to cut, you get rid of strange redundant choices, there will be an increase in the sales -- it will be a better experience in choice.
When President & Google went from 26 different types of Henry & Shakespeare to 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Gorgen Valley Corporation removes the products for cards that are less sold -- they increased the uses in 85, for two causes, higher sales and lower costs.
You know that today's supermarkets today, on average, they offer 45,000 products.
In a Wal-Mart shop they offer about 100,000 products.
But the largest story in the current world is Alice and offers only 1,400 products, a kind of tomato tomato sauce string.
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to manage better choices is the pain of David Landscape, the Harvard program.
All of the Harvard employees are automatically increased to a lot of safe life.
People who really want to pick up, offer them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know often people say, "I don't know how to cut it.
They're all important options.
The first thing I do is ask the employees, "That differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't difference, you can't make your customers either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with Gard.
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience a few vaccines with all paid to the world's most beautiful road.
Here, a description here.
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to read and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the orbit of Gary for you.
(Audience: Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the supply.
Isn't it more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that trip."
I think I really tend to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first round than in the second, but I can analyze and say they thought the second time was more real.
Because images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the survey of choice, which is to connect.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very vividly -- very concrete way.
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more in average when they use debit cards or credit than when they use effective event?
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to save more.
We did a study with Shara Benjamin and Alexander President, especially in BISES -- "The Tanzanian who worked at NGO, these people were in a meeting where they were being applied to a 40there.
At that meeting, we built exactly as they used -- we made a little addiction.
What we added was that we applied to the staff that they thought about the positive things that happened in their lives if they save more money.
With this minority there was an increase on the spaces of 20 and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their savings account.
The third technique is Clay.
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine.
We saw that in the West supply, throughout the North rule, the exhibition of magazines can contain from 330 different types to 66.
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to distinguish me.
These are two foots of jewelry.
One is called "March, and the other, "computer?
If you think the one on the left is Susanjam, the one on the right is Japan, it gives a paper.
(Audience apples? Well, there are some.
If you think the one on the left is Japan, the one on the right is Steven, gives a paper.
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is Japan and the one on the right is Steven." But you know what?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something that they choose, not the way they define them.
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
Suppose who are information?
My fourth category, Congression complexity.
It turns out that we can handle much more information than we think about, if we just simplify it a little bit.
We have to increase complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a complicated decision -- the purchase of a car.
This is a German general car manufacturer that allows full personalized.
You have to take 60 decisions, to add the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offer each one.
Colors, outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
Motor, change box -- four choices.
What I'm going to do is to vary the order in which decisions appear.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, at a few, four boxes.
The other half of the customers are going to go from a few choices, four boxes, to 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to look at.
How involved you are.
If you always act the button in every decision, this indicates that you're overwhelmed or not, you're losing them.
We found that those who are going from many options to a few, and they smell the button over and over again, and another one.
We lose them.
If they go from a few options to many, they go there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order in which information was presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to choose it.
Even though the choice box is not saying anything about the preferences of the inner decoding, we somehow prepare us to choose it.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more hooked with the process.
To summarize it.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the substance of choice, curve, eliminating strange alternatives, connecting, do it real -- Clock, we can handle more categories with less choices, and they drive complexity down.
All these techniques that I've presented to you were designed to help manage the alternatives or better for you, to use them in their issues, or for people who serve them.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being careful to pick up.
And the more careful we are in our choices better we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the '70s, in the East Germany, if you had a typewriter machine, I had to record it to the government.
I had to record an example of an example written with the machine.
And this so that the government could track the origin of the text.
If you found a writer with the wrong message you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we didn't conceive that somebody could do this, how much this limited freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a color printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow dots in every page that you follow a pattern that makes them each other and its printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to get a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what's going on in the online world, we can grab the attacks according to their attacks.
There are three main groups.
The civilizations are.
Like Mr. Dime Gulf of the city of King, in Ukraine.
The cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cybercriminals to make a lot of money, increased numbers.
There are really many cases of military online, multiplying money with their attacks.
This is Verian Transanly, from Tambro, Stanford.
This is Alfred Governor.
This is Stephen Wall.
This is Big Steven.
These are Matthew Anderson: Tasmanian Allen and so on, etc.
These guys do their online forms, but they do it by illegal media using bank transparences to steal money from our accounts when we buy online, or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy in an infected computer.
The secret service of the United States, two months ago, frozen the Swiss account of this lady, Sam Japan, and this account had 14 million dollars when he was frozen.
Mr. Jack went and she disappears his paradox.
And I say that today is more likely than any of us will be victim of a civilization than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of attacks in importance that we see today is not motivated by money.
There is another thing that moves, they motivate the protests, they motivate the opinions -- they motivate the laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been disappeared in the last 12 months holding a paper down in the online attacks.
Those are the three main attacks, the criminals that do it for money, the hungers like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national states the governments that they attack.
And then we see cases like the Diplomatic.
That's a good example of government attacks against their own citizens.
Diamond is a constant authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
He declared the last fall, because of a knowledge.
They took safety from the site and they would perceive a changing.
Last week I asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were looking at the death of people in the attack to Diamond.
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die, because of an attack of these?
Diamond is a certified authority.
They sell certificates.
What do you do for the controllers.
Well, you need if you have a website with the goal, synthetic self-assembly services, services like Google.
Except that I interviewed a foreign certified authority.
And they prevent advertising centralized.
And in the case of Diamond happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in Egypt.
Well, in Egypt, the protesters had taken the headquarters of the secret police in April 2011, and during the business of the building, they found a lot of paper.
Among those papers was this catastrophe called "Starry."
And within that folder, there was notes from a company with dinner in Germany that had sold the government Egyptian government for large-scale interviews of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280,000 euros to the Egyptian government.
The head of the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools to totalitarian governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, he found the School translator, a train used by the German government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are suspicious in a good criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is intervened.
But today it goes further.
The Internet connection.
It will use even tools like the School translation to infect our computer with a Trojan to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like this, the obvious answer should be "Okay, it seems bad, but I really don't affect me because I'm a honest citizen.
Why would you care?
I have nothing to hide.
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privilege is not discussion.
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
While we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right we respond to today, will be forever.
We rely on any future government, in an administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nativian Parkinson's Park.
These are the cows of my dad in the background, and behind the cow, the National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi is not close to most of the south, which means that wild animals like the limits migrate out of the park.
And predators, like lions -- follow them, and this is what they do.
They kill our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we woke up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only tower we had.
My community, the masses, we think we come from the sky with our animals and all the land for paralyzed, and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with the lions.
The dying are warriors that protect our community and the livestock, and they're also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, at age six, is responsible for livestock from his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that actually this didn't serve, because even help the lions to see the study of far.
I didn't laugh me. I continued.
A second idea was to use a spinal.
I tried to send the lions to the lions to believe it was near the way.
But the lions are very clever.  They came the first day and they saw the spinal, and they went out, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So they jumped out and kill animals.
So one night I was walking around the stage with an antibiotic and the lions didn't come.
I discovered that lions are afraid of the light to move.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the one that comes up and turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp.
It all arrested everything.
As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery and the battery supply the electricity to the little individual box, I call it a transformation.
And the indicator box makes light sidewalks.
As you can see, the lightbulbs are going outside, because that's where the lions come from.
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights shoot and send the lions to think that I'm walking through the star, but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never come back to have problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had made a lot of animals kill the lions and asked if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
I put them. You can see the background -- these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea also is used now all over Kenya, to scare other predators as a hyena as a hydrogen, and it's also being used to spread elephants from farms.
Thanks to this invention I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brazilian School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and awareness.
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to put them.
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the predators of my father's cows -- and I used to see airplanes flying up, and he told me that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to become an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
So I see it. What my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't imagine how exciting it is to listen to a story like it.
So you get a scholarship. Richard Turkey, yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one in your list?
RL: My next invention is: I want to do a close electrical close." CA: A close electricity.
RS: I know you already invented the electric fence, but I want to do mine.
CA: You try it once, right?
We're going to animate it in every step that I was, friend of mine.
Thank you very much. RM: Thank you very much.
When I was a little boy, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Not England.
And I felt very proud.
In school, we spent all the time studying Kim Israeli, but we never learned much about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Although sometimes I asked myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed all of a sudden.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister's colleague of mine.
That he said, "When you read this, the five members of the family will stop existed in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We're reconstructed together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak. We're ready to die."
I was very closer.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I walked in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't delete from my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child skiing in his arms watching his mother's face without being able to do anything.
Nobody helped them, because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine fled to North Korea in the middle of the '70s.
In the end, more than a million Norwegians died during the famine and just a few survived bombs, insects and tree cortex.
They were also made more and more of the energy cuts, everything around me was completely dark at night except by sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and us.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the Amazon River, which serves from limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very analyzing in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross secure.
But many die.
Sometimes I see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the years of hunger, I was sent to China to live with distant patients.
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined to take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like North refugee.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult but also dangerous, because the Norwegian refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was revealed, and it would be repeating a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was interested in police station.
Somebody had accused me to be normal, then I was looking at my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was terrified.
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and delay.
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answer the questions.
At the end of the interface an officer said to another, "This was a false report. She's not normally.
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some of us in China are looking for asylum in foreign emissions.
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and deposited.
These women were very lucky.
Although they had captured them, they were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These norms were not so lucky.
Every year, you know normal normal are captured in China and sports to North Korea, where they're tortured or encouraging or executed in public.
Although I was lucky in climbing -- many other nodes have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that the Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all its world can ride it in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity -- I've decided to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
We're going to go to South Korea was a much greater challenge than I would expect.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South America.
We're all correspondents, but inside, we have come to be very different because at 65 years of division people.
They even run a crisis of identity.
Am I surprised or normal?
Where am I? Who I?
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call a pride of mine.
Although adapted to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the income test to college.
Just when I started adapting to my new life, I got a careful call.
The North Korean authorities were involved with some money that I sent my family, and as a punishment -- my family was going to be delivered to the force to a platform in the outside.
They had to run away.
And so I started planning how to help them escape.
The nodes have to travel long distances on the way towards freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So ironically, I took a flight to China and got me up to the border with North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, in some ways, for over 3,000 miles across China, and then through Asia.
The bus trip took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and addressed by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification, and he started asking asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to my family, I would improvise me and I told him that they were solidarity people who were addicted.
I looked at it surprisingly, but fortunately I thought I did.
We did all the way to the border of Lakes.
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Lakes.
But even after the border, my family was arrested and encouraged by crossing the Indian border.
After paying boats and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But in time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of Lakes.
This was one of the lowest dots in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was in prison prison at the distance of South Korea.
I was in and came between the police office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribe or multiple.
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man asked me, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that an stranger asked him to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained to him the situation, and no doubt -- the man went to the automatic card and gave me the rest of my money to my family and for other three-dimensions prisoners.
I thank you all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do you help me?
"I am not helping you." He said.
"I'm helping the Norway people.
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The little unknown will sign a new hope for me and for the Norwegian village when we needed it.
And I showed you that the kindness of the unknown and the support of the international community are actually the rays of hope that the normal people need to need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many norms are separated from their families, and when you go to a new country, they start with a little bit or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of English language, labor practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping change North Korea from within.
I've been very lucky -- I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help you give nodes an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more normalized throws in the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Central Center.
This is Central Center, light stores, fast food, bad terrain.
So the city planners came together and thought, we're going to change the South Central Center to represent something more, so they changed the South Angeles, as if this would fix what is actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles South Andreats.  The light store, fast food, bad terrain.
Like 26 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, the American Center South, home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that food places to carry kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of curved diseases in Los Angeles Central Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater that, say, Beverly Hills, which is about 15 miles away.
I get tired of seeing this happen.
And I wonder how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of home you see the harmful effects that the current food system has in their neighborhood?
I see wheelchair shopping and sold as a car use.
I see cellular drugs like Stanfords.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
I also get tired of driving 45 minutes of anger and back to buy a apple that doesn't have periodical.
What I did was planted a forest forest in front of my house.
In a farm of land we call a garden.
It's 45 feet three feet away.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it on.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm coming to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to keep it on.
This is how I decided to keep going.
So my group and I, LOL, Green Greek, we get together, and we started planting our food forest, fruit trees -- you know, the nine full vegetables.
What we do, we are kind of a part of a group passed by the breaks of all the processes, all over the city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, he was beautiful.
Then someone complained to it.
The city got up to me on the top and in summary, and I was telling me a little bit about saying that I had to remove my garden.
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that no one matters?  So I was like, "Well, standing it."
Because this time it wasn't going to happen.
LG: Times had the story written by Steve Louis, and he talked to the conversation and one of the members of Green Greek, who put a petition in Channel, with 900 signatures -- we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My conclusion even called to say that I was responsible and answer what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
LED, it's the city of America with more bad terrain.
It has 60 miles of bad terrain.
That's 20 Central Park.
That's enough space to plant 500 million towels of tomato plants.
Why does it not seem good for this?
Growing up a plant will give you a few thousand seconds.
When a dollar dollar will give you 75 dollars of results.
It's my humor, when I say to people, grow your own food.
Growing your own food is how you print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Central Center.
I grew up there. I raised my kids there.
I refuse to be part of this manufacturing reality that was manufacturing for me by others, and I'm going to manipulate my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
The garden is my graphic, I culture my art.
Just like a grandmother artist, I started walls, I grew up soil, shrimp.
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my commercial of that canvas.
You will be surprised to see what the earth can do, if you let it be your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a tour is and how people affect people.
What happened?
I'm a witness of how my garden became an education tool, of transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You will be surprised to see how to affect the kids.
The garden is the most triculous and profit act that you can do, especially in a bring.
Also, they get fresh.
I remember an idea, who came to a mother and his daughter, were like 10, at night and they were in my backyard, and they went out and looked very supportive.
I, well, man, I felt bad to be there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I saw people who were so close to me with hunger -- and this is just going to give you why I do this, people ask me, "Well, don't you take people to steal your food?
I say, "Oh no, I don't fear you're going to steal it."
That's what it is on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at the same time, I want you to pick your health?
There was another point that I put a garden in a report to disappear at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, they helped me download the truck.
It was fabulous. I shared their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and their grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed them, so just for a moment.
So Green Greenhouse has come to plant maybe 20 gardens.
We've had -- like about 50 people who come from, work and participate, all on voluntary plan.
If kids grow color, kids eat color.
If you grow tomatoes, you eat tomato --  But if none of this is taught -- if you don't teach how food affects your mind and body, you eat blind to what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they're caught in. I see color kids who are in this path designed for them, that I don't bring them nowhere.
With the garden, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are getting away from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You might produce the next George Washington Carbon.
But if we don't change the composition of the Earth, we will never do it.
Now this is one of my plans. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same square.
I want to take content and turn it into healthy coffee.
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not talking about free things, because free is not sustainable.
The curious about sustainability.
What I talk about is to get people to work to people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening up markets.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become educational revolutions, stations, garden gardens.
We have to change the script of what's a station.
If you're not a garden, you're not a station.
How do you spend your road again?
So that is your choice.
In the way, if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see, I don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some member, to talk about making some member.
If you want to see, you come to the garden with your stick so you can plant something.
Paul." Thank you.
Thank you.
(Skateboard noises)  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of asphalt -- and the asphalt is a good material for driving, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that you can scan.
And especially if you go on your bicycle and these cars happen, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can do a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a silent road.
The solution for that is to make paradise stone roads.
The paradox sound, a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can happen through it, so all rain water flows up to the sides and will have a road that is easy to drive, and not support water.
The noise also disappears on these pores too.
Because it's very high, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road.
It also has dentists, of course, and the downside of this road is that it can be departed.
What is the desert? You see that in this road the stones on the surface are coming out.
First of all, then many more and more and more, etc., and then, well, I'm going to do that.  But you can hurt your paradox, and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create batteries with that.
Oh, it's ready.
Backs, of course, that you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
And here you can actually see how the damage comes in this material.
It's a paradise station, as I said, so it only has a little amount of advertisement between the stones.
Because of the interview, the ultraviolet light to the open, this advantage, this general, the glue between the rituals, is carrying, and if you get together, it will be microbes and you will separate from the added.
So if you drive through the road, you will take the adventures, as you saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about authoritarian materials.
If we can make this material apply to it, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool from that to clean sides, and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the baby.
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel iron in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to cook -- an industrial machine.
The inflation can heat up, especially the steel is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel down, melt the bath, the baby flows through these microbes and the rocks are going back to the surface.
Today I used a microbes today -- because I can't bring the great estate machine here to stage.
The microwave oven, it's a similar system.
I put the sample, which I'm now going to take to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, they really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to try.
So they donated us a piece of roads, 400 meters from the AIDS highway, where we had to do a test cart to test this material.
So that's what we did there. You see where we were doing the train test, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We took the samples, we put a lot of charge in them, we repair them then with our parents' machine and we repair them back and tried them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've done a material using steel fibers -- incorporating these fibers -- using the energy of the road, actually increase the life of the road, they can even double the life of the surface, they actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they have curiosity.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
Actually, you have to get rid of first before I can show you how the repair acts are.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound sound in my house.
My father was listening to BBC, in his little gray radio.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news usually depressed.
"The Taliban was going? I wrote my father.
I didn't know what it meant, but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a real school, he said.
A morning they never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban came up from Afghanistan and made illegal girls that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I was seen as a child to hide my older sister who couldn't be alone outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could be able to educate them.
Every day, we took a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were.
We had to hide the books in the stock of the market so that it seemed like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us caught in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely hot in summer.
We all knew that we risk our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school is closed up for a week, because the Taliban suspended.
We always wondered what they knew about us.
Were we following us?
Did you know where we live."
We were an anti-sea, but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was appreciated and the daughters a trait.
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total engineering of a remote provinces of Afghanistan, and I insisted that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father was represented.
But my mother education became a teacher.
This is it.
It came back two years ago, just to convert our house in school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of all his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the tablets, despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate their children.
Over the years of the Taliban, I remember there were times when I was very frustrated by our life, and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, "Hey, daughter me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can force you to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, which is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we'll do it.
So you still want not to continue?
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the spinal, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I found myself here proud to graduate in Minister College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was except from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones to congratulate him.
He didn't just get out of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, and I carry it down in the streets of Katrina.
My family believed in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for me.
That's why I'm the global embasier of 1965, a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded SIN, the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risk for girls going to school.
What's exciting is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, advocating for them, despite them and even in front of a devastating opposition in front of it.
As Alex. It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter would go from the way from Sweden to his village, and literally they escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When he reaches his house, they are the phone, a voice would warn him that if she kept sending her daughter to school, he would try.
"You know, if you want it, he said, "But I don't hurt the future of my daughter for his old and bring ideas.
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom we succeed, there's a father who recognizes the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first compelling interventions of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the Taliban -- the girls who were to school realized in hundreds, remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes don't last much, after the U.S. troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who are advocating for them, I will encourage them, I see a promised future and a lasting change.
Afghanistan is a country of hope and unlimited possibilities and every day of Sola reminds me to me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have I forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the experiment, "Hey, resist Gardening. Look against him.
But you never become a Gaddle religious revolution."
They have spent almost two years since the light revolution was inspired by the glass of mass movements so much of the Tunisian revolution as the Egyptian revolution.
A force with many other light citizens, inside and outside of the country to call a day of factory and start a revolution against the fundamental regime of Garden.
And we did, it was a great revolution.
Women, young men and young men were in the search, pushing the fall of the regime, carrying freedom of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They have shown an example of the discussion of Gardening discrimination.
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the East East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a six months of brutal war and a few losses of about 50,000 dead -- we managed to release our country and defeat the tourism.
However, Gardening left a heavy carbon, a limit of therapist, corruption and surrounding seeds.
For four decades, the Gardening tourist regime destroyed infrastructure, culture and moral structure of liquid society.
The consciousness of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved a lot of other women, rebuild liberal civil society, demanding an inclusive transition and fair towards democracy and national reconciliation.
It was set up about 200 organizations in Benjamin during -- and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi, about 300 in Treason.
After a 33 year-old period, I went back to Libya and a unique enthusiasm -- I started organizing workshops about the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the platform of Women Lab for Peace -- a women's movement leaders, leaders, of very diverse orientation -- to advocate by the Soviet autonomy of women and for our right participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the president period, an environment that was increasingly politically, which is model of the policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a 17th, from National Congress in the first 52 years.
However, slowly enough, the effort of elections and revolution as a whole, they were disappearing, every day we found news of violence.
One day we wake up with the news of the old mosques of old mosques and southern tunas.
Another day I love with the news of the American embassy and the attack attack.
Another day we wake up with the news of the official murder of the army.
And every day, we woke up with the government of the military and their continued rape of human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society formed by a revolutionary mindset, and it is more removed from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The intelligence, the exception and the revenge.
I'm not here today at all to inspire it with our history of the success of crazy creative, and elections.
I am here today to trust that we, as a nation, we choose wrong, we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections don't bring peace and stability and security.
The crushing list and alternative between candidate and candidates brought peace and national reconciliation.
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still polluted and dominated with policy selfish policies and exclusive policies, so much for men and for women?
Perhaps what failed was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and inclusion values.
Our society needs national dialogue and creation of consensus more than we needed choices, which only reinforce polarization and division alone.
Our nation needs the qualitative representation of how female it is to need the numerical representation of it.
We need to stop acting as business agents and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female discourse that not just honor, but it also puts the marketing rather than the vegetable, the collaboration instead of the competition, the inclusion rather than the exception.
These are the ideals that a Libya, destroyed by the war, needs desperately in order to reach peace.
Because peace has an alcohol that comes from the interview and the alternative between female perspectives and males.
That's the real creative.
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it something sophisticated.
According to a version of the Koran Korea, paper, "is the word of the microbes God.
At the same time, the word "slip, which is known in all the automatic traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word "belover: simulation the female and material, which goes to all the humanity that men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have embedded.
And so, just like the uterus covers completely the embryo -- which grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion all existence.
This is what it tells us, "My microscopic about all things.
This is how it tells us, "My microbial mistake about my iron."
They are all given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about an intervention question, which has an equally unlikely answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to address is the one that everybody is doing always, why does she left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who was painting?
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that I will tell.
I was 22 years old. I had just completed at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in the Kennedy magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green green card American Explosive, and I had a very big secret in it.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I created my twin soul -- I was drawn to my head with a piece, carrying with balls of bored.
The man, which I love more than no one in this world, put a gun in my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of "the love, a psychological trap.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical assumption of domestic violence.
I'm a license in English at Harvard University and I have a McDonald's at the Walkan Business School.
I've spent most of my career working for the list of "The 500 list -- "The 500,000 to Johnson & Johnson and The Washington Post.
I took almost 20 years with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black laboratory and a mental Hans mining.
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all the religions, all the relationships and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the killing are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in intimate relationships -- interpretation and long duration or, it said otherwise, in families, the last place we want or expect to find violence, reason why domestic abuse is so unconscious.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would stay with a man who was stuck, and in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women between 16 and 24 years of age have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples and neutral nanoted in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met Congress in a cold and rain night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in the New York subway and started to flex with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also just taken away from a University of the Lead Way and he worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
I had a few big guys like advances, and a grandmother white hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that Congress did, from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it especially in the beginning in a period.
We started to go out and loved everything from me, which was ready, that I had gone to Harvard who put passion to help teenage girls, and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
Congress believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why the leadership in that school press and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence relationship is to stand and do it to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is analysis.
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I accepted my work and Congo and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling in a "button love, which was entering the head in a physical trap.
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And here is where they come into a scene that therapers.
As soon as we moved to New England you already know, that place where Congress was supposed to be so safe was bought three amounts.
One had a car balloon.
Another one was struggling under the pillow in our bed and the third always in its pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma that he lived from small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually were a message for me, and even though I had never raised my hand, my life was already in serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first Congress physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven o'clock in the morning and still had the shirt.
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother suit and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure we lived happily forever, because I loved him and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very close.
It just had been very overwhelmed by the wedding and by the fact to form a family with me.
He had been an isolated accident, and he never would make me harm.
I spent twice as much in our honey moon.
The first time I was driving towards a secret beach, and I lost me, and he gave me so hard in the head that I bounce several times against the car window.
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our honey moon, sat through the traffic and took a Big Mac cold to the face.
Congress continued to spend one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was wrong when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is victim of domestic violence, or in some time in his life, and the Center of Disease Control reported that every year 15 million children are killing, 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
I'll go back to my question: Why did I go?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly ancietive man, and it was the only person in the world that could help Congress face their demands.
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just mark?
Why didn't I go? I could have gone at any time.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we, the victims, we know something that normally you ignore -- is incredibly dangerous to abandon a magnetic.
Because the last phase in domestic violence pattern is killing.
More than 70 percent of the killers in cases of domestic violence occur after the victim has been end to the relationship, after we die, because then the advantage has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent access, even after the aging has become married, development of financial resources, and manipulation from the family justice system to terrified the victim and their children, which are usually forced by judges to spend time with the man who lost their mother.
And yet we continue to ask why does it simply don't go?
I was able to go, because of a last patent South that I saw my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if I had allowed it.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody, to the police, to my neighbor, to my friends and family, to complete unknown, and I'm here today because everyone would help me.
We have the tendency to entrepreneur victims like small headlines, which are supporting women -- well-being goods.
The question, "Why are you going?
For some people that are a way to say, "The guilt is yours for standing up, as if the victims are going to be able to understand the infection of men who want to destroy them.
But since I published "The London, I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who were also recording, that they learned an unexpected lesson of what happened to them and they raised their lives joyful and happy lives as employees, wives and mothers, completely free violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a very typical domestic violence.
I went back to marry a male and loved man, and we have those three children.
I have that black look and also that mining.
What they don't have to have to have ever more, ever, is a burden board pointing on my head in someone who says I want.
Right now, you are thinking, "Wow, that's fascinating, or "Hey, what dumb student, but all this time, I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, which are listening to me right now, which are being killed or that they were small or that they're anxiety themselves.
The evil could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love to break the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard about here.
The abuse is only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply throwing light on it.
The victims need everyone.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They pay the evil to the light talking about it with their children, their work companies, their friends and family.
It represents their vision of survivors as fantastic and lovely people who have a full future.
They recognize the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their scale and show the victims a safe output.
Together, we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the safe and peaceful oasis that should be.
Thank you.
Hi. My name is Cameron Rose, and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point there is an uncomfortable tension in the room because it shouldn't have come like this.  Luckily, I've brought clothes to change.
This is the first rock change on a TED stage, so you have so much lucky to show you, I think.
If some of the women are horrified when they came up, they don't have to say it now, but they found it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These guys are very uncomfortable, less bad than I don't have to use it.
The worst part is to spend this thing through your head, because it's when you're going to laugh from me, so you don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also surprises.
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a girlfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would raise the back and get the hair out of the child.
Of course, I saved surgery or an artificial brown like the one that I made two days ago for work, there is very little we can do to transform our looks, which, although surface and unchanging has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do to me, but in a symbol.
The first question is, how do you get model?
And I always say, a cartoonist discovered me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the benefit of a hemisphere, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage is.
Well, in the last few centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry -- which we're biologically programmed to admit -- we have also associated with a high and high figure, to the feminist and a white skin.
And that's my heritage -- heritage that I've known to make for money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that are now showing skeptical, and maybe there are some love of the fashion you say, wait. There are Newton: Takea, Joan Street, Liz Web.
First of all, the happy to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City all and each of the models in the runway, and from the 67 controlled models, only 27 percent, is less than four percent, weren't white.
The next question that people always do is I could be model when it's better?
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't really love that.
But then what I really would tell you every one of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a cartoonist of carbon and poetry, which would be awesome, because you would be the first one.
If after this spectacular list, you still insist -- no, no, Cameron, I want to be model, then I say, "I know my bomb.
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the reduction chief of the magazine Volum or the executive director of HIV, or the next Steven Media.
I mean, most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose to.
I'm going to show you all that I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike cardiovascular surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have done your studies, and you have a curator and a few jobs to your backs, no matter what you say, is to say, if you said that you want to be president of the United States, but your rsum.
The next question that people always do is if all pictures are completely.
And yes, it basically completely challenged all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture they took me, and also the first time I used a biologist, and I didn't even have my period yet.
I know we're entering the personal terrain, but it was a girl.
So I went along with my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a party party a few days before photos for the French Voice.
Here I am with my football team and the magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those pictures.
They are creation of a group of professionals, hairs, magnificent, photographers and stresses, and all of their help and people of faith and pressure, and they managed to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is: Do you get free things?
I have too much time in 20 inches and never use, except the previous couple but the privilege that I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free seat.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a driver psychopath, and a red server was saved in red and, of course, it would stop us, and it would be strikented to be able to continue to drive.
They enjoy these privilege by my aspect -- not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect without matter who they are.
I lived in New York City, and last year, from the 140,000 teenagers who were stopped and recorded, 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only 177, young black and Latino girls in New York, so it's not a question of stopping me.
But how many times would you stop me?
When I was researching for this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the 13 years of 13 years in the United States I don't like their body, and that figure gets up to 70 percent at 17.
So the last question that people do is, how is life of a model?
And I think the answer you expect is: If you're a little bit more thin and you have the brightest hair, you feel very happy and great.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe it looks like.
We say, it's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, incentives and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras -- what I've never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever wonder, with some more thin legs and the brightest hair, will be happier.
You only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most thin legs -- the brightest hair and the more radio to fashion -- but probably the most internal women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to analyze a race of racial and gender oppression when I am one of the biggest benefits.
If there is something that comes out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception that we have success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was higher enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more precious pictures -- and I wasn't me who I do.
There were no artistic directors, no strategies, no opportunity to repeat the photos -- not even a lot of care in the light.
In fact, most of them put them tourists at random.
My story begins when I found in New York City to give a power, my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the 50 and five pound.
He gave the chance that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When you approached the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take Santa to New York in a failed trip and keep the risk?
This is when we started asking the tourists that were going to get us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever had the camera.
So we were not aware of how much we would change this journey.
It became a sacred thing for us.
This picture is a few weeks after 9/11, and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day so that a five-year-old could understand it.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October, and we can think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at physical level, but in all senses.
Because even though we always take the same picture, our perspective change, my daughter comes up with new stories, and I can see life through its eyes and how to perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the trips -- we were walking up, when suddenly he stopped in dry and he pointed a red copy of the wrist store that I was looking at in previous visit.
And I described what had felt at five years of foot in that same place.
I began to remember his heart beating with force by looking at that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of engaging actively in the conscious creation of memory.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, it doesn't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who took the picture.
Today I want to encourage everybody to come up in the picture, and I don't want to go close to somebody and ask yourself, "Is it taking a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The burns are in the most threatened bird group.
First of all, why do they have so bad press?
It's also associated with Disney laughter personalized characters like mental characters, silly characters, stupid.
More recently, if you've been following the real Kenyan press, applause and algorithms these are the attributes that you associate with the Kenyan Paradia, but I don't accept.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment.  The parliament will not help prevent the spread of disease.
They're hardly monomous.   You're far away from extinction.  And my favorite, the burness have better present.   There are two types of sweet on this planet.
There are the business of the New World who are primarily found in the Americas, like the channels and the cartoons, and the Olympics of the Old World -- where we have 16 species. From these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the barriers important, first of all, provide vital ecological services, Linker.
They're our natural garbage collections.
They wipe the faces up to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria, help to absorb the number that not to be for them extended and causing large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no burns, the cadavers take three to four times longer in disability, and this has huge branching in disease spread.
The burns also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient Egyptian culture.
New Yorkers was the symbol of the protest and the marijuana, and along with the coastal, the unit between the top and the Egypt Bank.
In the Hindu mythology, Jack was the God burned, and risked his life to save the God Silly devil of 10 heads Randi.
In the Tibetan culture, they do a lot of important instruments to open sky, in places like Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to create it, so these burns provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with battery?
We have eight species of battery in Kenya, which six are in extreme threatened ambition.
The reason is that they're being engaged, and the reason that they're being poisoned is because there are conflicts between humans and the factor. The passive communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the burness are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of sweet are in the critical list of extinction danger, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years you get extinct -- and the reason is because it creates pressure of livestock that has been treated with an analog drug like Dividian.
This drug has been banned to use aid in India and have taken a position.
Since there is no battery, there's been a spread in the number of hot dogs in search of cartoons, and when you have hot dogs -- you have a huge time bomb for radio. The number of radio cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, 350 antibiotics are going to be above the Turkey lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
These are birds of birds.
In Western Africa, there's a horrible trade of dead burness to serve the bat and the feature market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're putting them transmission.
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that I travel through different countries, so you focus on a local problem is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in regional levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the burns, about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide.
How can they help it? They can become active -- they can make noise. They can write a letter to their government and tell them, we have to focus on these very inconvenient creatures. They donate their time to spread the word.
When they come out of this room, they will report on the battered, but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the battery.
They are very elegant -- Charles Darwin said he changed from opinion because he saw them flying without effort, no matter of energy in the sky.
Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do precision, my life, has been shaped for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From 1971 to 1979, I was young, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia Kenya, Corner and Somalia, in terms of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for an Italian NASA, and every project we set up in Africa failure.
And I was paralyzed.
I thought, at the age of 21, the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we do is we added it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, "Good Facebook. It was a project where we decided to teach people in Zambia.
So we came up with Italian seeds to the south of Zambia.
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so we paid them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't help.  We were astonished that local locals, so fragile valley, didn't have agriculture.
However, instead of asking how it was possible that we didn't grow anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  "Wonder in time to save the people in Zambia.
And of course, everything in Africa is completely grown.
We got these great tangions, in Italy, a tomato growing up to this size. In Zambia.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the challenges, "Look what easy is agriculture."
When the tomatoes were both bad, mass and red, overnight.
And the shoulders said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why didn't they say it -- "I never ask.
I thought we only do the Italians commit mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what Americans did, what the English did, what the English did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the hypertension.
You should look at the wastes.  You should see the waste that we gave the people in the people in Africa.
You want to read a book, read "Marcus More, from Dartmouth Mark, in the education champion.
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I won't tell you about the damage that that money has caused it.
Just read your book.
It takes away from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are interventions, we are completely improvisation, and we treat people just in two ways, or we are pathway, or we are patients.
The two words come from the Latin root "slip, which means "I can "don't?
However, it means two different things.
Patriarchard, I treat any of a different culture as if you were my children, "I want a lot.
Patrick, treating all of a different culture as if they were my series.
So the white people in Africa are called "The Lash.
That book gave me a bit of a boat in the face -- "The Little is beautiful -- written by School, who said all over the economic development, if people don't want to be help, they were singing alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is to respect it.
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, can you imagine a city that is not neuroscience.
I decided at the age of 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called the Facebook Company where you never start anything, you never motivate anyone, but it becomes a service of the local passion, the number of local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? It falls out.
I now get to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of the local.
We don't work from the offices.
We got together in a coffee coffee in a coffee. We get together in a pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we find out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give someone an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once we hear them? But not in community meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
entrepreneurs never stop, and they will never tell him, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have identified it.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't attend their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face -- you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family physician of the business of business, who walks with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, in your coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of winning life.
I started this as a test in Hope -- Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this confidence that we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to say, "How can you do that?
How can it do it? And I said, "I have something very, very, very difficult.
And I went out and I heard them --            So the government says, "Thank you again.  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 business.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs that are dying of substance.
Peter Scratch, one of the greatest corporate partnerships in history, died at 96, a few years ago.
Peter Starbui was a philosophy professor before we got involved in business, and this is what Peter Scrapper says, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and an innovative company.
Plantation is the kiss of the business spirit.
So now you can rebuild Christian with not knowing what the most amazing people in China want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people close to conversation with you.
You have to offer them privacy, private conflicts, has to be fantastic when you help them, and then you'll get it, they'll come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion.
What would you show you more this morning."
People who are passionate about. That's what you have happened.
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non-viruses fossils -- non-viruses, and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
The frequency as a way to sustain machinery is not sustainable.
What we need to think about is how nurses, we cut, educating them, transformation, we communicate seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who's going to invent technology for green revolution, universities? Forget it?
The government, Open."
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a random story that I read in a future magazine makes many, many years.
There was a group of experts that were invited to debate the future of New York City in 18th.
And in 18th year, this group of people gathered together -- and they speculate about what was going to happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was only only -- the New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyze the curve and pointed out, if the population keeps growing up to this rate, to bring it to the population of New York to the around, would take six million horses. And the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address it.
They were already being standing in standard.  So in 1880, they were diagnosed with this dirty technology that would absorb New York life.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States came up with 100 automotive manufacturing companies, 2007.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely absorbed and there were very few schools, schools, factories in apartment places.
Delicious, Michael Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer confidence.
Otherwise they won't come to talk to you.
Then, you have to offer them an absolute thing, depressed, enthusiasm.
And then you have to have to tell you the truth with the extinction.
The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things which are magnificent -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to count with a fantastic commercial, and you have to count with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We have now met a single human being in the world that can do, selling and looking for money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've investigated and looking at the 100 icons of the world Carlie, Williams, Edison Earth, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Canada.
There is only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one, none of it was started by one person.
The word "Yeah, but the word "Candle, 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
Nobody begins a company alone. No one.
So we can create the community where we have facial, who comes from an environment of small businesses in coffee carbonance, based on their dedicated depressions who are going to do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talks about this support, somebody who asked you, what do you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, can you sell it? Can you look for the money?
"Oh, no, I can't do that, "I want you to look at someone?
We act communities.
Thank you.
Those surrounding us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we're not going to exchange a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like contractions, plausible and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do I pay my neighbors for their apartments.
How can we pay and ask them to pay more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do we share more memories from our abandoned buildings and understand our landscape?
How do we share our hopes to the empty stores so that our communities can reflect today our needs and dreams."
I live in New Orleans, and I'm in love with New Orleans.
My soul always finds a relief with giant robots who give shark to love, barriers and soldiers for centuries and trust in a city.
It's always a stuff in New Orleans.  The city has one of the most beautiful architects in the world, but also one with the greatest amount of abandoned properties in America.
I live near this house and I thought how I could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was John, as a mother for me.
Her death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death.
And this produced me a profound gratitude for the time and lived with me.
He gave him clarity to the meaningful things of my current life.
But I was happy to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to leave the day to day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant picture and painted about her phrases to complete completely, "The More Marker designers?
So the transplant could take a chalk. They would reflect about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept connections.
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
"Before dying I want to be judged for paradox."  "Before dying I want to sit in the film of fish change line.
"Before dying I want to sing for millions of people."
"Before dying I want to plant a tree.
"Before dying I want to live outside the network.
"Before dying I want to thank you one more time.
"Before me of dying, I want to go to someone's rescue research."
"Before dying I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space was taken together and dreams and hopes and hope of people made me laugh to them, and they were destroyed, and they gave me in hard times.
It's about knowing that you are not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and collective ways -- it's about giving you the replacement and content, and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and change.
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit and now have been done in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together we demonstrate the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express them and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distraction, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve perspective and remember that life is brief.
death is something we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that makes us more power.
Think about the climate death our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what matters us as individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fear and stories, the people around us can not only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request today.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers now.
Remember is 22 years old, it's high and very brief.
I don't talk about, but it carries better joy than some of the best speakers.
Remember knows what love is.
It will be increasingly sharing what happens.
It's not analogy. It doesn't look at the skin color.
It doesn't care about religious differences and focus on this, never lied.
When I singing songs from our childhood, trying to provide words that I didn't even know, I remember one thing -- how little we know about the mind and how wonderful the unknown should be.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's high. It's very gold.
It has the most impossible memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
I don't remember if I stole my chocolate, but I remember the year I came up with each of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, discussed in my arm.
Doesn't it look incredibly?
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because your minds don't adjust to the concept of society, often they're ignored and informed.
But what drives my heart and forced my soul was even if that was the case, although I didn't consider them inside the order, that could only mean one thing, which were extraordinary, autistic and extraordinary ones.
Now, for those less familiar families with the term "basemets, it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical abilities.
In every individual it becomes a different way, from there that Remeten is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that quickly increase in the world, there's no cause of knowledge.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
You shout a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He went alive and recovered in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars around the room, looking at the washing washing and eating anything that had been in between.
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences became more evident.
But beyond the barrels, the frustration and the international hyperactivity -- there was something really unique, a narrative and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without pressures, a human being that had never lied.
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there have been some tough moments in my family, times when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuals, communication and love, and I realize that they are things that I didn't want to change for normal.
The normal thing goes through the beauty that makes us differences and the fact that it doesn't mean that some of the wrong is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could convey one thing to Reeky and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that we have, are a donation, each of us has a gift in their interior, and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for gravity, progress and change die at the time where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what I should have been to be Alice in the country of the Marines.
Penn Stanford asked me, a communications professor, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  And I was scared from these students with their big minds, their big books and their big words.
But when we developed those conversations, I felt what Alice should have felt when I fell through the rabbit hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with students, I was surprised by ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to environment and health care, among others, and if we don't know about this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't scientists have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, personal people with simplicity.
I want to share some suggestions about how they can do it to make sure we can see that their science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question to answer, and then what?
Tell us why science is relevant to us.
We don't just tell us just to study the tragedy, but they study the tragedy, which is the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat openness.
And when they're describing their science, they care with the jargon.
The jargon is an obstacle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say "sliping and temporary, but why not say "I have and time, which is much more accessible to us?
So making it accessible is not the same as to make them.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples and stories and analogies -- they're ways to engage and engage with their content.
And when you present your work, forget about the signs of "The "Looks.
You have wondered why they're called "slime?  What do the bats do? The balls kill and killing their presentation.
A film like this is not only boring, but it supports too much in the language of our brain and opened us.
Instead, this tiny example of Georgetor Brown is much more effective -- it shows that the special structure of triangles is so strong that it actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower Town.
The trick here is to use a simple sentence, legislation, that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that will open our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what it is described for.
I think these are just some key key key key key that you can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, for all the media, take a simple one.  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English Dictionary is "despair."
Just because it sounds very well.
And "The Web means "sliping desperately?
Although there was a personal editor of the 19th century that it was much better when he said, "One "beautiful, is that you look for a public charge without matter for partner, platform or principle, and that, when you win, you get it by the use of a very self-destructive very much constant.
I have no idea what "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The "The Stark means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate language.
It wasn't until 17, for example, 1706 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the parliamentary camera.
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the name of Brazil.
They got him in the London Tower and they were going to get caught up, but he had the enough courage of dealing with them, and at the end he had a popular support in London that he won.
And just a few years later, we had the first round use of the phrase "The Boy so battle?
Most of you think it's literal to it.
It's not. It's because of a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
They didn't know.
How do we call the leader of a Republican country?
This is debate in Congress for a long time.
They were presented all kinds of suggestions that might have fragmented.
Some of them wanted to call it "The State of State Washington, and others, "I'm Carnegie George Washington, and other "Looks of the U.S. Library in the United States.
Not very absolutely.
Some people just wanted to call it "Hey?
They thought it was very quality.
And not even with it was monkey, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a certain run.
And it could have served up.
Everybody gets tired of the world, because this debate comes up for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor sensor, and I always wrote, "All with this topic.
What caused the retrofit, and it was that the Republican House was against the Senate.
The Republic House did not want Washington to be able to be power.
They didn't want to call it King because he gave him or his own ideas.
So they wanted to give the more modest title -- more interesting and more safety than it happened.
And that title was "slapping."
President. They didn't invent the title -- there was already before, but it just meant "I would predict a meeting?
It was like the president of a judgment.
And I didn't have much bigger than the term "slip or "Starry, "The Stanford."
There were energy presidents of small colonies and government fractions, but it was really an unsustainable title.
And that's why the Senate is opened.
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it President."
"This guy has to sign treated and meet foreign digitals.
"And who will take a serious title with a title.
And finally, after three weeks, the Senate Senate Server.
We can learn three interesting things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been able to make the president of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to follow there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says a measure is temporary --                                                     
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and with this, I want to leave you, is that the president title of the United States doesn't sound at all, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to available, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of artists are not trivial and so on.
The reality and the story has gone to the title of great.
So at the end they won the Senate.
They got their title of responsibility.
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of synthesis, well, was a synthesizer everywhere.
But you know how many nations are now president?
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end of the Senate Senate and the Republic of Republican lost because no one is going to feel humble when they tell them that they're now President of America.
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I would like to leave you.
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, it really makes a lot more the words that what these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under land in an illegal mine of Ghana.
The air is charged with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the robot of support bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but most of all, that capital of male time and stones parallel with primitive tools.
Like others, I carry a cheap light bar of light attached to the head with this angles and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole of that sea that falls hundreds of meters on the ground.
It turns out my hand, and suddenly I remember a mining I met days before, which I lost control and I fell up feet in that point.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep part of that hole risking their lives without paying or reward and often dying.
I came out of that hole and I went home, but they will never do it, because they're a piece of slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only exhibition in the Paris of Valley Peace.
Among all the amazing people I met there I met an integration of "Step The State, an NGO that is dedicated to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not such a degree in the world.
When we finished talking, I felt very bad, honestly I was embarrassed to ignore this approach of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I came up with a string and weeks later, weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of "The Standard and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had already been in many of these places.
For some, even I consider them my second home.
But this time, I sold the dirty trains.
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million school people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced throughout the whole deal of transplanting the transitional slaves.
150 years ago, the cost of an agricultural slave was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 days.
But today you can enslave them to entire families by generations of number 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been angry with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without pay, under threat of violence, and they can't escape.
Today the slavery operates in trade, the goods produced by slaves have value, but who produced them are destroyed.
slavery exists in almost everybody and yet is illegal all over the world.
In India and Nepal I met brick bonos in India.
This weird and formal show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the hell of Daniel.
Invisions in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire family families wrapped in a heavy piece of dust, mobilized mechanically brick in their heads, up to 18 at a time, and they take them from the attacks to trucks who are in hundreds of meters.
Let's go down the monitor and the song works in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There were no papers to eat, not to drink, and the severe demographic made it pee it was pretty interesting.
So performance was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and I stopped working.
Every 20 minutes, I had to run into the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to get back, and I sat there, I thought, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the oven, I wanted to cry, but the antibiotic who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't do it. Don't do it."
And I explained very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't a citizen of that country.
I could put it into a worse situation than they were already gone.
I had to rely on "Step the Stars and work inside the system by the liberation and trust that they succeeded.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas I found kids running rocks for miles by miracles that were waiting down.
Those big planets were more heavy than children who were grateful and children put them up to their heads with hot courses made from sticks and ropes and horses.
It's hard to witness something that opens.
How can we influence something that interestingly, but so unbelievable?
Some of them don't even know that they're slaves -- they work 16 or 17 hours a day without pay, because this has been their whole life.
They have nothing to compare to.
When these villages were recorded their freedom, the slaves.
When I hear the word school we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global awareness I was glad that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In Katrina I was getting women who had been previously school slaves.
They drove me through a few angry stairs that went to this dirty basement of the light light.
It wasn't exactly a business.
It was rather a restaurant.
Somehow, as you know in the office, they're local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the slaves are with their girls and children, some of just seven years old, are forced to train the clients and encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each dot is dark and distribution, identified by a painted number on the wall and divided by a biomass and a curtain.
Workers often suffer from sexual abuse by hands of their clients.
From foot on the loss, I remember making sense of an airline fear -- and at that instant, I could barely imagine what it must be going to be stuck in that hell.
I just had one step, the stairs where I entered it.
There were no dead doors.
There were no windows enough to travel.
Those people don't have supermarkets, and because we take a topic that is so hard, it's important to point out that slavery even is sexual traffic, it happens to us.
There are hundreds of school people in agriculture, in restaurant in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times report that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sex slaves.
It happens everywhere, but we don't see it.
Texts are another activity that we often relate to the slave labor hand.
I visited Indian villages where there were foreign families in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
The hands of black are from the father, the blue and red, of their children.
They mix the tubes in these big barrels and throw the silk in the liquid to the elbow, but the ink is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no freedom. They said.
"We hope, though, can come out of this house one day and go somewhere else where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 schools in Lake Alan, the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a family family in a boat, two older brothers -- some younger kids -- makes sense of it?
Eric. They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their flatters and disappeared and forced them to work extinct borders on these boats on the lake, despite not going to swim.
This kid is eight years old.
When our boat was afraid he was shot, he feared his little canoe was embedded.
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling the water.
The branches branches of the trees plunged on the Australian Lake often catch networks and children, and favorites and fear and fear, they throw into the water to unleash the branches.
Many of them are showing.
Since it remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to flee and, as all life has been treated with critical, he tries to treat the younger slaves under their winter.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they lifted up the latest networks, but they had been working from one one of them.
It was in the cold and vertical night.
And I know that these networks spend more than 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to Kosovo.
Kofi was rescued in a village village village.
I met him in a refugee where he started to release the school for slavery.
Kofi symbolizes the possible.
Who will come to be thanks to someone decided to make the difference in their life?
They drive through a road in Ghana with some single search companion on the State, an anticipation companion with his engine to suddenly accelerate our car and touch our window.
It asked us to follow it for a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, he taught us to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed up this sense just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road. Come on!
As we started to go down, we took the embraces that block the road, and after walking about an hour we found that the path was attached by the recent rain, so I put the phone team on my head as we went into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of walking, the story was ended up originally in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with school workers.
Many women had children attached to their backs, and while they were looking for gold water, they walked into the water poison of methane.
The marketing is used in the extraction process.
These miners are scanned in a pit in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the canopy they were involved in their own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, irrigation, because many had been under 72 hours.
The pits have 90 feet and these people are carrying heavy pockets of stone that then will be transported to another area where they multiply the stone so they can extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and vibrant men, but if you look closer closely, the margin is going to be working at least lucky and also children.
They're all victims of leadership, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this museum ends up like this victim of T.B. and entrepreneur for mercury in a few years.
This is Manhattan. When his father died, his uncle took him to work with him in the mines.
When he died his uncle, he Mandela inherit the debt of the uncle that force him to be slave in the mines.
When I met it, I had worked on the 11 years and the lesion of the leg you see here is a product of an accident in the mine so severe that the doctors said it should be an employee.
In addition to that, Manhattan has tuberculosis, and it is not about that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
And yet, he dream with being released and educated with local activists like "buttons the Stars and is this kind of determination of face to a remote possibility that inspired me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
And I wanted you to know that we would give the testimony of them and do everything possible to help change their lives.
I always think that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not magazine. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, that deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I don't think about these beautiful people, killed, that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in who you see them, in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out a fire and that fire throws light on slavery because, without that light, the beasts of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math app and there's a peculiar problem for who we do, we're like management confiners.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today I'm trying to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We dislike the variables of the whale and the click dancers --  that we'll see more ahead.
But the ballet gave a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial appetite that you can have a genetic component.
Sadly, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's pattern gradually destroyed this extraordinary skill, as I do with my friend Jane Strigmant who, in his time, was a virtual value of ballet ball.
In the last few years, it's been a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are six billion people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with an incurable depression, terrible, rich and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and central metric of it.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other movements of movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurologic exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a tough journey to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam themselves.
They didn't need personal people.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as not conventional form to try and try and try and see -- in a sense, at least, we're all virtuous as my friend Jane Strigmant.
This is a video of the vibration of vocal strings.
It shows somebody healthy as they go to speak, and we can imagine as a vaccine bank because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes necessary -- the Foundation, for example.
And like the ball, it requires a level of extraordinary training.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning how to speak.
From sound, we can trace the position of vocal strings as they vibrate and how the Parkinson's affects the extractions, it also affects vocal organs.
On the bottom of the bottom you can see an example of the irregular shots of vocal strings.
We see the same symptoms.
He claims volume, weakness and rich.
The speech becomes more quiet and associated after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do these tests compare based on the voice with the specialized clinical trials -- well, both of them are invasive.
The neurological test is not invisible. Both of them use existing infrastructure.
It's not necessary to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
Both of them are precisely. Well, but also the tests based on voice are not specialist.
I mean, they can be self-assembly.
They do very quickly, they take about 30 seconds like a lot.
They are missing cost and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so low, it appears at massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address it.
We can reduce the logistical difficulties of patients.
He wouldn't have to go to the clinic for routine charge.
With high-speed monitoring, we could get objective data.
We could do low cost of low cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, we fall on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking at the first biospheres of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Portal Voice Initiative.
Along to Alan and Patricking, we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines accessible for about 750 million people in the world.
Any of us, with or without Parkinson's -- can call up a price and leave recording for a few cents, and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So Mars, take all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, can you say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What about these shows?
Max Lincoln, yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have disease. TK: Sure.
MJ: You see, some people can not happen. You may not end it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data collected in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for limits the factors of confusion in pursuit of the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a 86 percent accuracy at this time?
MG: Much more than that.
Actually, my student TV, I have to publish it -- has done a fantastic job, and now it's shown that it works in the mobile phone network too, which makes the project. We now have an 99 percent accuracy.
TR: No TV, Nicolus and nine. Well, it's an improvement.
MT: Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Lincoln, public.
MG: Thank you, Tom.
Before 2011, I was doing photographic restaurants in New York City.
We are clients -- gray creatures.
We hide in the dark, in rooms without windows and usually we avoid solar light.
We make the models even more delicate, the perfect skin is even more perfect -- we do the impossible and possible, and we are in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of images and photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the tragic events that happened in Japan.
Shortly later, an organization where it was voluntary -- there Hans Young, was in the place working as part of the answer team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 traveled to Obama.
It's a little town of fishermen located in the preventing of the Iraq of almost 50,000 people -- one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The average water level is over 24 feet tall and over three miles in the ground.
As you can imagine, the village was devastating it.
We took rubble from channels and bars.
We clean up schools. We take the side and leave the houses ready to be renewable and reducing.
We take tons and tons of dead fish -- apart, letter of local factory.
We went through and loved us.
For weeks, so much volunteers as the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and cameras and Cart.
Everybody did the same thing.
They would pick up and bring them to different places of the village around to struggle.
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had suffered people.
As I went out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help a center of the village entire week.
He helped clean the bathroom together the big, giant bathrooms.
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the crash center collected the photos.
He took them, and I had the honor that that day would trust me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring -- I had heard about the expression to think beyond the horizons, but it wasn't until I was traveling myself in my hospitals that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some of you who had more than a hundred years old some of them were still on the lab, I couldn't help us think about how to fix that trait and repair that rate and met hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contact some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started to pick up the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too striking, but where the water had declared the face of the girl had a lot of accuracy and delighted.
Otherwise, that girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having the wrong picture.
Over the time time, they came for luck more photos, and they needed more records in Facebook and Lincoln and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
At the age of two weeks, I had 150 people to join together.
In Japan, in July, we moved to the Research, a neighboring village north of Vietnam.
Once a week we used our scanner in the terrorist photographic libraries that had been installed, where people were going to record their photos.
The time that you took in training is a different story, it depends on the decline of the photos.
It could be an hour. I could make weeks.
It could make months up.
This tiny man had to draw almost by hand using the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures plunged in fresh water, bacteria, bacteria, with algae even with oil, all of that along with oil, all of that along with the step of the destruction of time, so by cleaning it by hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't pick up the picture unless they were clean, dry and had been replaced by his owner.
We had luck with the lawyer by hand.
We count with the guidance of a neighboring neighbors.
It's very easy to hurt the pictures of the days.
As I said a White, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky on the photos.
He had started to clean herself out, but he stopped to realize that the damage even more.
He also had doubles.
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not be able to rebuild it, we could monitor the images in a single picture and they would reduce the whole picture.
When you pick your pictures share some of your story with us.
A few colleagues from his husband found the pictures in a fire station between the rubble pretty far from where their house used to be, but their colleagues recognized it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter of closing the barriers into the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the simple ones sound.
Their little children, not as small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took a week to find all his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day he gave her lower little son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could do -- something that he could go back to look, something that could remember from the past that had not been beaten by that March day when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there and hundreds of them helped us clean hands by hand over 12,000 photographs -- the vast majority of most of them were going to hands of their owners important.
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us to return to 90 families of completely slippery and reduced photos.
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for printer.
We took pictures constantly.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a place, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They're guilty of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing we would take to look for.
This was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to somebody their connection to the past.
When a picture like this will give someone, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also makes a big difference in the life of records.
Some of them connected to a little bit larger, to give up something, using their talent for something that is not perfect skin.
To finish I'd like to read this electronic email -- I sent it to the day that I came back from Japan after six months.
As I redefine, I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women from different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathered around a baby, confirmed me, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, I and my daughter was born -- I broke out of our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few our basic needs are the same, right?
Thank you.  applause.
Jack Adventure inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that went through an apple in an exhibition of a million seconds.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion to a billion frames per second.
I presented a new kind of photograph, the fertilizer, a new technique so fast that it can create videos in slow camera of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the rivers, beyond the vision of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and it really challenges the idea of camera.
If I take a laser dot and I turn it up and put it into a second or a second, in several feminists to create a picture of photons from just a million wide.
And that photograph of photons -- that ball, will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet ball.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and we shoot on this bottle, how do those photons go into this bottle?
What's the aspect of light in slow camera?
Now, all of this --   remember that all of this happens in less than a nanotechnology is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola does not push this research.  So there's a lot of things in this film, and they have this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our ball, comes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to go through it, and that, inside, start to disappear.
Part of the light goes off, goes to the table, and we started seeing these colleges.
Many of the photons finally come to the roof and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel through the table, and because of the replacements at the top of the bottle, you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several frames that the implications are concentrated.
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow cameras to about 10 billion times, how much do you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  from a slow ball in motion.
And what about the death nature?
You can see the waves that spread from the table, the tomato and the wall of the bottom.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It's the way nature painted a picture, thinking, from a female at a time, but of course, our eyes see an integral composition.
But if you look at one more time, this tomato will realize that, as the light gets out of the tomato -- it goes brilliant. It doesn't dark it.
Why? Because the tomato is mature and the light is in its inside and comes back after several seconds of second.
In the future, when this female is on its mobile phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is mature without having to touch it.
Why did we create this camera at MIT, for?
As a photographer, you know, if we take a picture of low exposure, it enters very little light.
But we're going to have a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition -- so you just get into some light.
We sent that battery, that photograph of photons -- millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very anti-section synchronize and we took those data galaxies and interviewed them, to create those traits that I showed you.
We can take all those data in crude and process them in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible.
And if a new power of a superhero.
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, Report, entering the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light reductions.
It's not science fiction. We've already built it.
On the left, it's our field.
Behind the wall there is a manufacturing and reduced light in the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature Community.
And a small fraction of the photons went back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our female, it has unique capability.
It has very good temporary resolution, and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what point they run to what distance.
When you project a laser -- you can record a picture in gross -- you see on the screen, you really don't make any sense.
But we would take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, we'll pull them together and try to analyze the multiple light reductions, and with that, can we see the hidden object?
Can we see it in SIN?
This is our reconstruction recovery.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the curve.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build each other able to see the inside of the body solidarity body and the same for cards.
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists so that they start thinking about shame as a new model of visualization to solve the problems of imagination in the health of the next generation.
So as Dr. Editroyan, he was a scientist, converted science into art, an art of photographer for the particular.
I realized that all the dangers of data we collected each time are not just for scientific visualizations, but we can.
create a new form of computing photography with slow camera and color code.
And look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few bills of seconds.
But here is something fun as well.
If you look at the waves under the roof, these are getting away from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects -- Einstein would have loved this image.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes appear to the camera.
They apply the corresponding definition of space and time, we can correct this distribution.
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A cell phone can change life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone you can photograph a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a phone you can take a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile cell phone, you can record a song to Steven and get famous.
All of this is possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a Chicago Chinese and living in the city of Berlin City.
Let's go back to that moment, this city.
And here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are protecting a change.
This is the fall of 1989, imagine if all of these people come together in search of a change, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
Who has a cell phone here?

Raise your mobile phones, letters.
Let's read it. An Android -- a Blackagram, business.
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone.
But today I'm talking about me, my cell phone, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 dollars of information.
Brown data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a democracy.
The data Department of Data.
This direction says that every European telephone company, every single Internet provider in the entire Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls who he sends an email to who he sends an email to.
Who sends him a text to who a text.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and even two years old, in its phone company or its process of the Internet.
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data design.
We want the contraction in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone to be able to store all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people coming out to the streets of Berlin and said, "Hey, not fear.
And some even said this would be Stage 2.5 percent.
The Sun was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this works really work.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the mobile?
So I asked my phone telephone, Department TV, who at that time, was the largest phone company in Germany, who please.
And I asked them once, and I would ask them to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all blah blah black.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are prototyping my life.
And so I decided to set up a judicial demand because I wanted to have this information.
But Peter TV said no, we don't give you this information.
At the end, we signed up an agreement.
I took the demand and they sent me the information that I did.
Meanwhile, the German constitutional Court failed the anti-sea for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly, about brown with a CD inside.
And at the CD there was this.
The three-dimensional and five thousand spinal lines of information.
I looked at them and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I spend the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to go.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the data performance means.
So, along with Keith Online and Oprah Data City, we did this.
This is a six months visualization of my life.
You can zoom up and go back, go back and forward.
You can see every step that I do.
And you can see how I'm going from Francisco to transit Colona, and what often I call on the journey.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not only about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how their people communicate each other to what time they call each other, which time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to who speaks to who, who makes him an email to who, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said to the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
And the Sun had known who involved in this protest, and if the Sun had known who the leaders were, this never happened.
The Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And in fact, neither of the Corner Court.
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to store it forever.
But the self-assembly and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the advanced.
You have to fight that every day.
When you go home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value, and it's not going to be full of fashion.
When you go home, give your representation that just because companies and state agencies can store certain information, you don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, you ask your phone company, what information store you from you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phones to remind you to remember you have to fight the contraction in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, what happens?
I call me May Zapparton and I'm not drunk, but I know the doctor that brought me into the world.
I cut my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have cerebral paralysis -- that's why I tend all the time.
Look at me.
It's a right thing. I'm like a Shakespeare mixture of it.
And Muhammad Al.
The P, C is not genetics.
It's not contact or can't control.
No one mall the uterus of my mother and I didn't tell it because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It only goes through accidents, like the one that happened to me.
Now, I'm going to warn you, I'm not a source of inspiration -- I don't want any of the present to you.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, they have wanted to be disabled.
We're going to go.
Christmas views, are in the mall center, driving in circles in search of parking parking and what do you see?
16 empty places for disability.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little distribution?
I also say, I have 99 problems, and the P, C is just one of them.
In fact, an oxygen learning, I would win the gold medal.
I'm a Palestinian, Muslim Muslim woman, woman, disabled and living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park Clinics, in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same initiatives.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I could.
A lot of people with brain paralysis don't walk, but my parents don't believe in the "Not not?
The mantra of my father was, "You can do it, dance sacred."
If my three older sisters. I clean me.
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents were sued to the school system and made sure that I was also out of it, and if we didn't take the whole note on the top of my mother's short.
My father taught me to walk at five years to put my bags on his feet and just walk out.
Another technique that I used was to put a dollar in front of me to chase it up.
The shooting that I carry inside was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten garden was walking like a bag chart that has received a lot of spinal.
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabs -- and they keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't Islamist.
This was before 9/11, and that politicians thought appropriate to use "The Muslims.
The people I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed to be worried about hunger during the record.
And I told you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so I would have to talk about the dawn of the love is very easy.
Barrier fell in Brooklyn.
Yes, in Brazil. It's crazy.  My parents couldn't pay the physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with songs, or I can walk with songs.
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be a kid, so if my friends use songs, I too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents feared that if we don't go back to Palestine every summer, we will become Machine.
In summer vacation often, my father was trying to surrender, so I had a little bit of a deer, and I was putting hot cups on my back, and I was holding myself on the Dead Sea, and I remember the water burned me and I thought, "Well, it works?
But the miracle cure was the foot.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I did yoga I was a state comedy that I couldn't put out of foot.
And now I can stand in my head.
My parents reinforced this idea that I could do anything that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the general hospital Hello.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the USA, University of the Arizona, because I entered all the cars.
It was like the mass landscape of the theater department.
Everybody loved me.
I made all the tasks at least intelligent -- I knew the maximum note in my classes and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass of crystal my teachers crying.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, I decided to make a work called Dance very slow in Jackson very slowly.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy, right?
I was a girl with cerebral paralysis.
So I started screaming at the four versions, "The End will have a paper."
I have cerebral paralysis."
In the end, at the end of the foot."
Thank God touching God, I am free?
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to Sharon Brown.
I went to understand the director of the theater department, crying historically, as if someone had killed my cat, to ask why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Good, if I can't do the risk stunts without the character."
He was a role for which he had literally been born and gave it to an actress without brain paralysis.
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of autonomous actors without disability for pathogens of disability.
By graduation, I returned home, and my first tour was kind of an extra thing in a telescope.
My dream became reality.
And I knew that it would be a chance to "advertise, to "divine.
Instead, I stayed there as a grass, I didn't look at me more than the new one, and it was evident to me that the repair directors don't hire garbage actors, not white ants with disability.
They just hire perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching Wall Goldinos, Robert Barren, Elia, and all these women had one thing in common: they were commenses.
That's why I made me human.
In my first tour, I took famous companies from New York to New Jersey, and I would never forget the face of the first comic I took when I realized that I was at high speed at the height of New Jersey with a driver that had cerebral paralysis.
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censor and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first monopoly in the Arab world.
I never like to record the first place, but I know you never heard that little nasty rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother from another mother and father, Dean Obama, and I launched the Filman Commission Festival in New York, now in his 10, year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the separations in the media and at the same time remind the repair directors that South America and Arabic are not sensitive.
To integrate Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited the news news program back with Keith Olympics.
I walked in as if I went to a graduate dance, dragging me to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "What can you give you another cell?
She looked at me and said, "Oh, four, three, two?
And we were live.
So I was clinging to the desk of the presentation to not get out of the screen during the seat, and when I finished the interview, I was plant.
At the end I had my opportunity and designers. I knew they wouldn't be invited.
But not only Mr. Olympic went back to invite, but it was kind of like a full-time participant and pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct Keith Oliver was that people on the Internet are school.
children are said that kids are cruel but they never get rid of me or girls or older.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of the bush.
I saw online clips like, "Why do you translate?
"Are they ready?
And my favorite, "Professor terrorist duration.
What disease does it have?
We should really hear for it.
A company suggested even that I would add my disability to my curator, white, comments, paralyzed.
Disability is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't be done from Ben, then Beverly can't make someone in the wheelchair.
Disability are steel, yeah, apply, man. Come on.
Disabilities are the largest minority in the world, and the most self-assembled minerals in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said not walking, but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with the media of communication, I don't think it was gone.
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that's less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My torture has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to lunch by the red red carpet of the Telescope Susan Lucival and the Lorre Arthur Christmas.
I came to act in a film with Adam Santa and work with my double, the incredible Dave Matthewing.
I remember the world coming up, "The Arabs have become locomotion?
I was delighted to represent the great state of New Jersey in the 2008 of 2008.
And I founded "The Children of Manhattan, a charity to give kids refugees to Palestinian reductions a piece of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me live in alive, and he gave this talk to his memory.
(Audience in peace, pain.
I call me May Zappant, and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a kid of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know her story.
It lives in a small town to South Star.
This village is near Montana.
The drought drives small people to poverty and the edge of the innovation.
No nothing for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, Montana, the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there's no opportunity -- there's no job, no future perspective.
He ended up living in a tent in the city to outside Montana.
After maybe a year later, nothing.
One day I read a gentleman that offers him to take it away, and then to dinner, to deliver.
I know a dynamic group of people, which gives you a descent.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home, to his family.
I'll introduce you to a young woman.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in Montana, under a blue sky is a bomb car.
That little boy of that little village with the dream of the great care was suicide terrorism, and that dynamic group of people were to the Shanghai, a terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him and high?
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for a chance, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came in.
This was the first thing that I took away from what we call "the waiting period."
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the magazines, young urban urban people who were delivered distributed in Johnson, delivered riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the work "button.
For young people, the whole city promise -- the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of work, of well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest waste rates.
By 2030, three in five people who live in cities will be less than 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them opportunities -- the story of the spectrum of the spectrum, the door of access to terrorism, to violence, to gangs -- will be the story of cities.
And in my city of birth, Montana, 70 percent of young people are unemployed.
70 percent doesn't work, it doesn't go to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to Mountain last month, and I went to visit the Made Mandarin, the hospital where I was born.
I remember going on to that random hospital to baseball thinking, and if I never went to me?
And if I had been forced to be in that same spectrum of wait?
I would have become terrorist."
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in Montana that month was actually to bring a few juvenile leaders on a business card.
I went to about 90 young juvenile leaders.
We sat down, and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges that the city faces.
One young man in the room was Adam.
He went to the University of Monterey, graduated up.
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a graduate university, unemployed, frustrated, was the perfect white for Al Shakespeare and other terrorist organizations, to be recycled.
They were looking at people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In Montana, the biggest obstacle to get from point A to B is the streets.
Twenty years of civil war have completely destroyed the video system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to mobilize it.
And I looked at an opportunity and it was approved.
He started a motorcycle company.
It started by encouraging local residents who were normally couldn't buy it.
I bought 10 motors, with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motors over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different story do?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit, and I think business spirit can be the most powerful tool against the workplace.
They hurt young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so desperately looking for.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Muhammad Mountain, a flower.
I was helping to train some of the young people in the course of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative.
In fact, it's the first flower that Mozart has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until Muhammad came, if you wanted flowers for your wedding.
If you asked someone, "When was it the last time you saw fresh flowers from?
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be, "No."
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company company and design company.
I created a farm in the outskirts of Montana, and it started growing therapies and lights, which was by saying, could survive the climate hard of Montana.
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding floors, creating gardens in the homes, and the city companies, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in Montana in 22 years.
There's no public parks in Montana.
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the proverbial robots.
By the way, he doesn't grow pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Moughness had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO working for government, but their story, their innovation really had a strong impact on them.
I forced you to look at your city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, which could be a change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They created business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to guide them in development and put their businesses.
They connect young people with the resources that they need, the support they need to move from consciousness to creation, and create catalyst for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mountain is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park -- that's how I call it, when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
I managed to hire kids from the street to help rent and keep the motors for him.
They gave them a chance to escape from the paralysis of the "working work?
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn young people in entrepreneurs -- they go up and feed their inherent innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks than free and paradox from the Pault than automatically and "participant.
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to my dad in the English mountains, an area attached to north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The central forest.
The sun made the leaves to shine as a visit, and not to be the path that we go, we can almost pretend that we were the first human beings to weigh that land.
We get to our camp.
It was a computer in a row with a beautiful critical lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the council there was a stream, from about four feet square of advertisement of advertising paper balls and old capital.
And I was analyzed, I was very angry, incredibly confused.
The campaigns that were too lazy to take out what they were tradition, who thought he was going to clean their battle?
That question followed with me, and a little bit simplified.
Who cleaned our battle?
No matter how you organize or where you put the "angle, who clean our trash in Stanford?
Who cleaned our trash in Rio or Paris or in London?
Here in New York, the Department of Health clean our trash -- to reason of 11,000 tons of waste and 20,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that clothes?
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through their travels and interviewed people in office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still an interview.
I needed to get more.
So I started working as a garbage collection.
Now I don't just travel in the trucks. I drive.
And I operated the mechanical scales and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asks about smell.
It's there, but it's not as accurate as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong is used very quickly.
It costs a lot of insight to weight.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies were following the weight of taking over their tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Labines -- the restriction of waste is one of the ten most dangerous substances in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and enter the traffic all day and pass around your surroundings.
They just want to happen, so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the worker.
And also the garbage itself is filled with dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the insurance of garbage.
When you get out of the morning and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
He never stopped coming.
It's also like a breathing or circular.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that the stigma is especially ironic because I think the waste of waste is the most important works in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
These are the first players of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste and efficient shape every day, this starts to break away from your continents and your inherent dangers threatened us in very real ways.
Disease that we had controlled for decades and centuries go back and start doubled.
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the motors of the economy start to fail when it's in danger the consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just to follow your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average average speed need.
And I just mean the speed to the speed that we used to move in the fourth contemporary time.
We usually don't worry about, we don't repair or close or take our coffee cup with us, our band boat, our water bottle.
We use them, we took them, we forget about them, because we know there is a work force on the other side that will get rid of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the waste of waste that may help reduce stigma and increase in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost limited.
They're on the street every day, in a rhythmic way.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when you expect.
And their work allows us to do ours.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us out of ourselves, from our own waste, our destructions, and that flow always has to stay in a form or another.
One day after September 11th, 2001, I heard the chart of a waste truck truck on the street, spread to my small son and lowered the stairs running up, and there was a man doing his paper recycled journey like all the microscopes.
And I tried to thank him to do his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just statement, and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I started investigating the waste of waste and I went back to that man.
It's called Pakistan, we work together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that Paul was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to rebuild the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and count all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The municipal waste -- what we think when we talk about garbage -- they represent three percent of the number of waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistics.
So on the flow of your days and your lives, the next one that you see somebody whose job is to clean the trash of you, it takes a moment to recognize it.
Take a moment to say thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life to be part of the environment where architecture is born naturally of conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are sitting in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analytics from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example began with an invitation to design a commercial center of several stories in the capital of Ethiopia, Adam Obama.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, and my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out right?
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to resolve.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the crash with crystals generates heat in the inside, so you need a lot of energy.
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And third, your aspect has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame of a place that rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was really captured with the old market that's this structure in the free air where thousands of people, and they go and buy things every day to small windows.
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a modern building, from several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented by the inspiration of the site, which is located in an area of a lot of the city growth, where most of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was we create a connection between these two streets, using all the inputs of the building.
And this extends with an income attack that creates an air space in the building that was supported, in its own way, from the sun and the rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the shape of space.
I also thought, how do you close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that responds to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a hip capita with performances to allow the input of the air, and also the light, but in a fluid way.
Then we inspired ourselves in these beautiful buttons of the stairs of the electronics.
They have fractal geometry, and this helped me model the factory.
We're building that with these little purple pieces that are the windows that let the air happen and light in a way controlled in the inside of the building.
This is consistent with these little colored crystals that use the light inside of the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It wasn't what we ask.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market turned out to be much more profitable than the commercial center of the commercial center because at the end of the company there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of dancer was much more economic -- not only because of the material in comparison with glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a big advantage to put photographs on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that create this urban oasis.
And these parks in the roof, which is in the middle collect water for the interior streets.
It's expected by the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in Tunisia.
And to do a project that big project, the biggest that I have designed -- I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention in the middle, a thousand year-old structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve doors of access connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the existing streets -- creating 12 similar initial blocks in size and features that there is in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these papers.
In addition to that, we selected some strategic points in relation to the idea of interconnected doors with straight lines, and this modified the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell of the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the medicine climate?
And it's Northern, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and therefore a natural ventilation.
So we supported a scheme that makes sure most of the apartments are perfectly engaged in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with papers, and then in the low plant we have all the connections for the pedestrians in it.
And also respond to local norms that make a greater density in higher levels and a lower density on the low plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like removed to the community that space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and social and make the activities like running a two miles in the morning, or jumping out of a building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions but affordable solutions that improve the relationship between community and environment, and they have as a goal connecting nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl went into our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had large amounts of hair, very brilliant hair, and a little bit of penguins -- bit of lights, it was very strong for the capitalism of states, very good for brickling.
I ended up that year and I was full of celes, until I took my silk plan.
One day I got a time after the school of school, I was a little late and hidden in the girl of girls.
When the cost was stripped, he walked out, entered the classroom, took from the table of my teacher the book of grades.
And then, I did.
It altered the ratings of my rivals, just a little bit, just some like this.
So all of the case.  And I got to give you back the book to the box -- but to see, some of my other roommates had very good notes as well.
So in a sentence, I ran the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put every row from I and myself a row of this, just to be there, because I could ...
I still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good to do it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why they never catch me.
It was all desperately obvious.
They never discovered me.
But most of all, I got rid of the reason why I was annoyed that this little girl, so small, was so good for bribe.
I was intrigued by the cents.
They're so mysterious and so perfection.
We know that babies suffer from celests.
Also primate birds are very precise.
We know that the celests are the number one cause of biomass in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that analyzes the loneliness or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which you study the cells in all your possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no celes, there would be no literature.
It would not have Head the infection, no saying.
There would be no celebrity center, or "The 15 and a night.
There would be no Shakespeare.
They went through the reading list of high school, because we would be losing "The Rame and the Furas, there would be no "Come and "The Farth would be losing "The Boyle "The "Look Kobi."
No celes, there is no Professor. I know it's fashionable to say that Proust has the answers for everything, and in terms of the cents, almost they have it.
This year, 100 years ago of his master play, "In seeking lost time, the most extensive study of sexual seats and also from ordinary competition, my own, everything we could have.  And thinking about Proust -- we have the sensory details -- right?
We thought about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think of a brown magnitude in your washing lab.
We forgot about how hard that image is.
We forget about how improvisation it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia World said were as hard as cat train.
I don't know what the cat train, but we assume it's super.
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the cents, the beaches and Professor.
Is it going to be very obvious as the celests, who reduce the person, to their wish, to their implications, are a solid narrative basis?
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel celes.
When we feel celes, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being at the same time and audience, we know exactly what details to include to crack the knife out, right?
The celests make us all the amateur neuroscientists, and that's something that I tried to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And he starts telling himself that story, and since then, I tried to say that every single sentence that Standard determines in his lover, he adds to his collection of torture instruments in his private camera.
You have to admit that Street and Proust were notoriously celebrated.
You know, the Protestant novels would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so clean to recognize that it's a tough job. Right?
The celests are supported.
It's a hungry emotion. You have to feed it.
And what are the celests?
The celests are noticed from information.
The cents use the details.
The stacks like the big quantities of bright hair, and the nice and small set of pies.
The celests are noticed from the photos.
That's why Intelligence is so successful --  I proposed the language of the academic language with the cents.
When Standard is in its block of single stores, I suddenly hear behind doors and bribe the sections of his lover -- then they describe those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is representative, but it's not unlike the interpretation of an old text or looking at a monster?
He says, "The scientific research with real intellectual value.
Proposal is trying to prove that the hairs look unique and they make us seem absurd, but in their minister, they are search for knowledge, search for truth, a painful truth -- in fact, to what Proust considered -- the more painful the truth is better.
Pain, humiliation -- loss -- these were the pathways to the Proust wisdom.
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us to make a range of feelings much deeper and vital than a wise man who can be interested."
Is it telling us we're going to look for cruel women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the beaches revealed us ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us open in this particular way?
Is there any other emotion revealed us our aggressive, our horrible ambition and our rights?
Any other emotion that teaches us to look with such a peculiar intensity?
Freud writing about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very clever young woman who was consumed with the idea that his wife got it.
And Freud says there was something weird in that man, who didn't stop in what his wife did.
Well, she was innocent. Everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he would look for things that his wife did without realizing involved behaviors.
Is it going to have a little bit of a say, or is it accidentally read with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the corner of the unconscious of his wife.
novels are very good at this.
Now, the novels describe very well how the celests make us look with intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely wealth we are, the more we become a fantasy residents.
And for this reason, I think, the celests lead us to make violent or illegal act.
The cents drive us to behave in totally unintended ways.
Now I'm thinking about me about eight years old, I recognize it. But I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michael 52 years old was captured by having created a false account on Facebook from which you send lives and horrible lives, awful itself, for a year.
For a year. A year.
She was trying to instill the new girlfriend of his night story. I have to trust that when or this, react to admiration with admiration as well.
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge, even though unfortunate -- creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
It's like a novel of Pathenia Harvard.
Hydicoco is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the car of the thing in a train, and "The Taliban Mr. Rio, books that are trying to how the celests, they confuse our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the cents, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be a chance in a second.
Take Tom Rio, its most famous character.
Tom Rio is going to want to want or want what you have to appreciate from your being and get away from what you ever had, and it's under the floor, and it takes your angel, it takes your rings, you empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the roof of Tom Rio.
I can't give you all of the world, as much as I want to.
It's a pity, because we live in time of envy.
We live in cents of cents.
That is, are we good citizens of social networks, where currency is the entrepreneur, right?
The novels show us the way? I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're in a mystery.
Let's go to the 21st of Baker Street and ask by Robert Hollywood.
When people think in Hollywood, they think about the male male in Professor Professor -- that criminal genius.
But I've always been preference, and I have always been presented by Seattle World Radio Radio that needs Hollywood desperately, needs the genius of Holocaust, but he annoyed it.
Oh, it sounds so familiar."
Lestor needs his help, but he respected it, and he was smoking with limits in the each of the mystery.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The Angeles of six Nationals, once Dutch comes in, he would shoot everyone with his solution, Lestore back to Hollywood and says, "We're not jealous -- Mr. Heartbody's signal.
Are we proud of you?
And he says there's no person in Scott Wall who didn't want to shake my hand.
It's one of the few times we see Hollywood translating in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the celests as a problem of geometry without emotion.
You know, in a Dutch minute is on the opposite side of Lesters.
The next minute are the same side.
Suddenly, Lestor is allowed to admit that idea of being the restruction.
Could it still be so simple?
What if the celests are really a problem of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get away from the excellence of the other.
We can deal with it.
But I like continuously conflict.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have the fiction for consciousness.
Just the fishery fighting the cents.
The fiction used the footprints, I invite them to the table.
And look at what it would be done, the sweet Lesterland, the territory Tom Rome, the Louis Louis -- the same Margaret Professor.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, 1969, Buzz Albert jumped outside of the Apollo 11 and he discovered about the Martin Sea Sea.
Armstrong and Alice were alone, but their presence in the super-surgengest gray was the culmination of a contemporary collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest movement in peace times in the history of America.
To get to the moon, NASA spends about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died people, including the Apollo 1.
But before the program Apollo finally, 24 men traveled to the moon.
I was walking on their surface, which Alexander after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the oldest one.
So why were they?
They didn't get a lot of back, 38 pounds of old rock rocks, and something that 24 will spread later, a new sense of the small and the fragility of our common home.
Why were they? The cynical response is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate the Soviets that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in 1965 give us a better idea.
John F. Kennedy -- some questions, why is the Money?
Why would we turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why did you climb the highest mountain to me?
35 years ago, why would they fly over the Atlantic?
Why do I play Rice against Texas?
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason Monterey: For contexts, Apollo was not just a West victory on the East War in the Cold War.
In the time, the strongest emotion was to wonder to the transplant of the power of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do it.
The landing in the moon happened in a context of a long list of technological training.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In half the century, polio police is eradicated and eliminated smallpox.
The technology seemed to be what Alvin Tower in 1970, called "slippery access?
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with video, but in 1969, the Apollo 10 flew at 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being around the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo 10, and the optimism joy about the power of technology has been evaporated by seeing that problems that we imagine technology would go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seems to be interested.
I remember seeing the Apollo 17.
And I was five years old, and my mother told me that they don't look at the Spanish Salad rocket.
I knew that this would be the last flat mission, but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's what happened to our ability to solve problems with technology, has become a common place.
I hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists had been distracted and they had enriched with trivial toys, things like iPhone, applications and social networks or algorithms that accelerate the automated window.
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But they don't solve the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a particular explanation in Silicon Valley, which is confidence that has been created less ambitious companies than the years in which Intel finally, Microsoft, Apple and General.
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs themselves.
Silicon Valley says that venture investment causes creating ideas of ideas for the funding of incremental problems or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It explains mostly what's wrong in Silicon Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their fixed point without worrying about risk, they prefer small investments of investments that could go out in 10 years.
The Chicashurs, they've always had problems to invest with benefits in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long-term -- they have never invested in development technologies to solve big problems because they don't have an immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and deep.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we want to.
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that would never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar and wind, and biology, less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
The coal and the natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the biological.
We want alternative sources that can compete in price. There are no exist.
Now, technologists and entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties incentivize the development of alternative energy, mostly a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the carbon price.
But there's no hope in the political climate today that we will see an American energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus together.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for a long time that famine is a result of failure in the food report.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that are carefully affecting food distribution.
Technology can improve things like contractors or systems for food store, but there will be famine as there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes choose a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war for cancer in 1973, but soon we found out that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable treatments.
Hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we have, but these four elements have to be presented -- political leaders and population must want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the solution, it must really be a technological problem, and we need to understand it.
The Apollo mission has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, and it meets those criteria together.
But it's a completely international model in the future.
We're not in 1963.
There's no released competition like in the Cold War, there is no policy like John Kennedy who inherit the difficult and the dangerous thing, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction as that to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon it turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And it really wasn't even solving any problems.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't lack the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start by remembering the widespread ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they have become clicks of our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a record, there's been a great decline of trust, it's a very widespread belief.
The second is a goal, we should have more trust.
And the third is a task, we should recover trust.
I think the record, the goal and the task has been wrong.
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a record, a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think confidence has depressed?
And if I think about the basis of my own evidence, I don't know the answer.
I got invited to think that it may have gone into some activities or institutions, and that could have increased in others.
I don't have it clear.
But I can resort to the opinions of opinion, and the polls of opinion are supposedly the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the polls of opinion over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are described 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, continue to inspire the same description.
And the people who were very reliable 20 years ago remain pretty reliable.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost about half the road.
But is this enough evidence of this?
So what the operations of opinion recorded are, of course, opinions.
What else can you record?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people manifest when they ask certain questions.
Do you trust politicians in the policies?
Now, if someone would ask you, "Do you get in the vehicles."
Counters in the fishermen?
Do you trust the primate teachers.
They probably started to ask, "Can you do what?"
And that would be a very sensible response.
And you could say, when you answered your question, "Well, trust me, but in other notos?
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to look at trust differently.
We don't assume that the confidence level that we're going to feel for a certain type of official, working or kind of person, is going to be uniform in every case.
I could, for example, to say that I trust a certain primary teacher I know to give you the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school microbes.
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good drive.
I could trust my most popular friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to get a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is difference, why do we leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more abstract way?
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to get the good inherent judgment in the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I would chase for.
I would aim to have more confidence in what is definitely definitive, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a particle of not trusting what is not reliable.
And I think those people who will play their savings with the very long savings called Mr. Mandard, who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too confused.
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
Deposition configuration or denied with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you tell it, it says, yes, yeah, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What's about doing a judgment about how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think in order to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
Are they competition? Are you honest? Are you responsible?
And if we find that one person is competitive in the personal materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be a trust.
But if, in contrast, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competitive and honest, but they don't rely on them to take a letter to the mail because they're of computers.
I have friends who are very sure they can do certain things, but I see that they survive their own competition.
And I'm very glad to say that I think I don't have many friends who are competitive and responsible but extremely desperate.
If it's like this, I still haven't been paralyzed.
But that's what we're looking for, confidence before it trust.
Trust is the answer.
The trustworthiness.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've been trying to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and so on, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as they should.
I remember once I was talking to a party and said, "Well, you know, the problem is that it takes more time to do the administrative paper that would look at the part.
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and institutional life, that the accountability system that is destined to ensure trust and confidence testing actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they do the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the parties, they were saying "completely the squares, as we say.
You may all know similar examples.
All of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more confusing, and that things would be different if we try to be trusted worthy and give people to people that we're trust, and if we try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the attitudes -- which is not very properly.
Third, the task.
To call the task rebuilding trust, it puts things upside down.
I suggest that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust -- ultimately, is different because it gives us other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough base so they can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't get analyzed, usually all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to take a quick evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do that?
That is done every day everywhere, all over the place, does the common people, the officials, the institutions, very effective.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks that I can get back without giving any explanations to it.
I take them up and give me the money, or I will change them by the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have trust in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing is not something very hard to distinguish.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have been striving to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that imagination can be departed.
This separation has been reduced, and more and more of a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I wonder, and if there was no barriers?
I started imagining what it would be.
So first of all, I created this tool that is embedded in digital space, so that when we push it strong against the screen to transform its physical body at the time.
Designers can satisfy their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool the barriers are broken.
But the two hands remained still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all of your hands?
In the different Microsoft Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor Carl Boston, they redesign the computer and transform a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
combining a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can raise the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab it directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives.
You can hold the book and take lines or words with the virtual technical sensor underneath every floating screen.
architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we are involved in the digital world.
What if we invest the papers and make digital information come to us?
Sure, many of us will be bought and put things out of the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
So what I have here is a virtual project on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a management device in your head or transition when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physicists so that we can touch them and feel it?
How would it be a future like this?
In the MIT Media Lab with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, my collaborator Ree Post, we created this only physical shot.
This space is behaving as a 3D pink in space, which means that so much computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
Similarly, what we did was analyze gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and mechanical attitude and detectors.
And when we digitally program the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can record and go back and forth in the physical world.
You can teach them physically, and at the distance and the famous to Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality the time we want.
Students can use them as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the monsters or textbooks or text books, this is a real and palpable experience that you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's most fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activity.
As you see, digital information will not only show us something but begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without that we have to get rid of our world.
So we started talking about a barrier, but if we suppress that barrier, the only limit that remains is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was trained to become a guy for two years in Hans, China, in the '70s.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer a school for athletes with all the paid spending.
But my mother the guy said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become an engineer, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed that there was just a central path towards happiness, safe work and remotely shorter.
No matter whether the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese parallel.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer must start training from very young to learn the alternatives, so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
And I wrote to the director of school and the presentation of a radio show.
But no adults would appreciate the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, no authority like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much greater to train it.
My dream was never done.
I mean, for the rest of my life a second class of the second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved looking for another volume.
No one around me wanted to teach me. Okay.
I remember books.
(Audience "Mom, South Charles? (Audience Electronic.
Those who were forbidden in China, of course.
"The Good Earth, the Chinese ethnic life.
And it's not a conventional propaganda.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a reveal, "I've got your father and your mother."
"Hey, "Hey, I said, "It's so different, and much better than you obviously?
So it became my tool to come out of this kind of contact classic and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And I meet a new culture also gave my body reading habit as well.
It provides a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
I was now occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
Compassion is not a new thing.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are research camps as compared to comparative religion and shared literature.
Comparison and contrast, offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it also in everyday life?
So I started reading books from two.
You can treat people [unclear] Francisco, Benjamin Assame from David Islamist, who were involved in the same side, or friends with shared experiences.
For the Crisis, the temptation are economic, policies and spiritual ones.
For the Buddha -- are all psychologists, lust, fear and social story? Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
(Music Word Wall way of Charles Muslims, Alan Watchers. Instead of losing in the translator, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that "The "Commercial in Chinese literally means "I really can "about Gaddy?
And "Star in Chinese, literally means "no mother, OK?
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know not to feel alone or impossible.
Having a destructive dream really isn't compared to what many others have suffered with.
I've come to believe that reality is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Until a dead dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, I am here, happy, living again with purpose and clear, most of the time.
So the books always accept them.
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first psychology client.
I was a medical student in clinical psychology in Berkeley, in Berkeley.
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex.
Alex walked into the first session using volunteers and a horrible roof, and he took on the couch of my office took the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so short.
My classmates had a pyramid as the first client.
And I took a vehicle that I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't do it.
With the Chinese stories that Alex brought to the sessions, I was easy to just move the head while we returned the solution.
"The trauma is the new sellers, he said Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work after, you get home later, you have kids later, even the death happens later.
For weeks like Alex and I had a time of standard.
But soon after, my support pushed me to press Alex to talk about his loved life.
I was resistant to me.
I said, "Oh, it's coming out with guys under his category, and he came up with a head head, but it's not like it was to marry him.
And then my support said, "All no, but maybe you get married with the next.
Also, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before it gets married.
This is what psychologists call a "Man: </s> moment?
It was when I realized that the three are not the new 20 percent.
Yes, people feel head after what they used was, but this didn't make the 20 of Alex be a pause in their development.
This made the 20 in Alex were the perfect moment, and we were wasting it.
So I realized that this benign negotiation kind of was a real problem, and it had real consequences not just for Alex and his loved life, but for the careers, the families and the future vehicles everywhere.
There are 50 million vehicles in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to adulthood.
Raise your hand if you're in your 20.
I want to see the windows here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with vehicles, you love a vehicle, you take sleep on a window, I want to see. All right. Imagine, real versions matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend at 35 years.
This means that eight out of 10 decisions and experiences and moments of moments, that give them a way to their life will have been in order to have 30 and so on.
People from over 40 -- don't train in panic.
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact about how much money they win.
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live or they're going out with their future couple at the age of 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in its 20s and will be repeated for adults, which means if there's something that they want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change.
We know that personality changes more times during their 20 than at any other time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its toy at 18, and things become complicated at 35 percent.
The 20 are the time to educate on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your daily life and common life has an impact in the person who will be transformed.
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our 20 are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the veterans are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of the adult time.
Researchers call at the age of 20 extra adolescence.
Presentations have been used to the vehicles like "slips, and "bellet"] and "slips?
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a trivial, which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonardo Berlin said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you give you the pat parties in your head and say, "Do you have another 10 years to start your life."
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency.
And then every day -- intelligent, interesting selections, like you or your children and daughters come to my office and they say something like this: "I know my girlfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "You are saying that while I start a career before the 1960s, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My 20 are to finish and I still have nothing to show you."
I had better curious the day I graduated from college.
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the 20 were like the classroom game.
They all run and get fun, but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everyone began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stuck, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had 30.
Where are the vehicles here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little extreme, but it's not wrong, the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the 30s, there's a huge pressure to the traumas and so many of you start a career, pick up a city, pick up a mate, and have two or three children in a much shorter period of time.
Many of these things are not comparable -- and there are research that starts to show that it's much more difficult and stressed to do everything from once to three.
The average age crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give you a brother to your son.
Many tribals and some of them look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and speaking about their 20, "What was I doing?" What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the veterans are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called Emma.
At 25, Emma came to my office because he was in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but he couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a memorial.
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend.
And despite living about 20 very difficult life, his previous life had even been more difficult.
He often cried in our sessions, but then she stood up himself to say, "I don't choose his family, but he can choose his friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I had just bought a new book for directors, and he had spent every morning dealing with her many contacts, but then he was looking at the empty space that followed after the words "The emergency case, please call it?
I was at the point of the story when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a car accident.
Who's going to care about if I give me cancer?
At that time, I got a lot of work to resist and not say, "Oh."
What Emma needed was not a therapist that was really worried about.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decision of Emma went in front of it.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all of us, man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma to forget about that identity crisis and get identity capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that adds value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the Emma career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this -- capital capital generates identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that inner company from that company that they want to try to try.
I'm not destroyed by version exploration, I'm destroyed the exploration that I shouldn't tell you, which, by the way, it's not exploration.
It's professional.
I told Emma to explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are supported.
The best friends are great to take the airport, but the vehicles that are together with friends with similar minds are limited in terms of who they know, what they know -- how they think, how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who will come out almost always comes from its closest circle.
The new things come from what they call the friendly friends of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the veterans have a bad job, or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the form of color to this group.
Half of the jobs created never published, then knowing the boss of your neighbor is how to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
Finally, but not least, Emma thinks that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a vehicle, I love to choose his family, when he has a partner and she forms his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You may think that 30 is better age to sit head than 20 or even 25, and I agree with you.
But you can choose the person that you live in now or you're going on now when everyone in Facebook starts walking towards the height is not progress.
The best moment to work on your marriage is before you have it, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
You can choose your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just to make it work or kill time with anyone who's going to do to you.
So what happened to Emman?
Well, we looked at that director and she found the roommate of a cousin that worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a work there.
That job of work gave him a reason to leave the bride that he lived with.
Now, five years later, it's kind of a special organization of events.
This married with a man who was considered.
I love his new career, loved his new family, and he sent me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contact are not big enough.
Emma story can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with with vehicles.
It's very easy to help you.
The vehicles are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles airport.
Just before the declare, a slight approach in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in Fish.
In the same way, at age 21, at the age of 25, a good conversation, a good conference, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next years or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea to spread to all the veterans that I know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex.
This is what I now have the privilege of telling us as Emma every day -- the training is not the new 20 years -- I record their adult, they get identity capital, using their weak links -- they choose your family.
They don't let them define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very successful job in management constant for a work that was even more expression, the doctor.
I went to teach sexual sexual students in the public schools in New York City.
And like any professor, I applied tests and testing.
I give them tasks.
When the work came, they calculated grades.
What was called the attention was that the C. wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have a state of court C.
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in seventh grade, safe, are difficult -- proportions, decorating, the area of a paralyzed.
But these concepts are not impossible, and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during enough time.
After several years of years, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a motivation perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the Chicago, but what if you succeed in school and in life depends on much more than ability to learn very quickly and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become a psychologist.
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of challenging scenarios, and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the International Academy West Poet.
We tried to predict what chains remain in military training and who was retreated.
We went to the National Conservation Council and we tried to predict what children will move the most far in the competition.
We studied novel teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods, asking what teachers are still teaching for the end of school and those who will be the most effective thing to improve the learning of their students.
We associate with private companies, asking ourselves, what about these marketers are going to keep their jobs at work?
And who's going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, it came up with a feature as an important prediction of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't the Chine.
It was determination.
The determination is passion and persuaded to reach very long-term goals.
The determination is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to its future, day after day, not just for week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a marathon -- not a career at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my determination of determination and then wait about more than a year to see who was graduated.
It turns out that the most determination of the most determination they had significantly greater likely to graduate -- even when I pushed them in every characteristic that I could measure, things like family income, the results of standardized testing, even the security that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not just on West Poet or at the National Center of Delation in which it matters to determination -- it's also in school, especially for children at risk of advanced.
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a solid job solid?
How do you keep them motivated for the long single?
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them a clue.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals that simply don't go ahead with their commitment.
In fact, in our data, the common determination is not related or even related to talent measurements.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination in children is something called growth call.
This is a developed idea at Stanford University by Carnegie Derek, and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed -- that it can change with the effort.
Dr. Deep has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how they change and grow in response to challenge, they're much more likely to persuade when they fail, because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop determination of it.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intentions, and we need to prove them.
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to wrong, to start everything again with the lessons learning.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more different.
Thank you.
Growing up in Taiwan as a hole of a head, one of my most expensive memories is my mother showing beauty, shape and figures of Chinese characters.
From that moment, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for an ambultion, it seems as improbable as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can remove this wall, so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the pieces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic understanding 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic literacy.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough to read transparency signals, restaurant menus -- understanding the basic idea of websites or newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it's square.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
Person.
If the shape of fire is a person with arms on both sides -- as if you were screaming in a fractal way, "God, I'm burning -- this symbol is actually originally originally originally the way I call it, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors from a song in the old West.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they think many more characters.
A person.
If somebody walk back, that's "slip."
As the ancient said, two are companies, three are multiplied.
If one person stretch their arms, this person is saying, "I'm like this big."
The person inside the mouth, the person is stuck.
It's a prisoner like Jane inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the grasslands.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a "Step."  Easy to remember, because a parallel tree is quite ideology.
Remember the fire?
Two fire together, it becomes very hot.
Three fire together, that's a lot of call.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's burned.
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two lines together, prepared.
Three together, those are destruction.
Put the sun and the moon back together, that's the break.
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon, France.
A door, put a table inside the door, is the break of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
Tom is there someone at home?
This person is coming out of a door, scale, evolved.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're discussing them.
Three women together, they have careful advance.
So we've already gone through about 30 characters.
When you use this method -- the first eight radiations will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundreds of cartoons, which is the same thing to learn an eight-year-old Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a fire mountain together.
We know that Japan is the Earth's land land.
This is a sun placed with the origin because Japan is east to China.
So a sun next to the origin we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains attached to each other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile because the Chinese employers were missing their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a output.
This is a slide to remind you that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love sharing my favorite films with my kids, when my daughter was four years old, we saw the U.N. magician together.
The movie mastered his imagination for months.
His favorite character was Globa, of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic variety.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and we raised our children in a kind of complex industrial shot show.
However, OK map was a self in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took four years later, interestingly, another film whose protocols, a metal kid and a billboard kid rescued a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the Oz map and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the Ocean magician.
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like apples.
But I think that if the Oz magician is done today, the magician would say, December, you're the OECD salvation as the phrase predicted it.
You use magic shoes to defeat the army generated by the computer map computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing from the U.N. map is that the most heroic characters, wise and even videos are women.
I started noticing this when I did Star Wars to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son as well.
It's just three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the substance level had gone down.  And so he stood in the room and he got impressed as a mom standing with his courtyards behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but inevitably, he absorbs everything.
I wonder what perceived.
Would you be value and personalized issues and letters."
Would you have the feeling that Luke is going to be an army to beat the government?
So let's compare this to the 1984 Mallow Mandaring.
How does Dorothy win his film?
So doing good mines with everyone and being a leadership.
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow OK, OK? And not a world of men who fight, which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital FOXO, force in movies for our children, and so small the way of yellow brick way?
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence movies in the girls, and they should read it. It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this stress.
I know for experience that the Linuage princess didn't provide the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults that's tiny.  I think at the moment of the first kiss.  I think the credit was really hoping that the credit would start to appear because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search has ended. I have a girlfriend.
Why do they keep standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focus on defeat the glass and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other adventures.
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a war suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and they defend the principles of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they, the guys, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend against patient, but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the patient.
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as Herbie and Katrina, but they don't stop being war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all time continues to appear in classic after classic -- every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who are holding a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year finally came out Bar.
I recommend all of you. It's available in stores.
Remember what the critic said when Valley.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a prison.
It's very good. Don't let it stop them.
Well, almost none of these films pass the test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't yet left roots and already spread, but maybe we're going to start a movement.
Alex Beijing is a comic drawing, and in the middle 1980s, he recorded a conversation I had had with a friend about the evaluation of the movies that they saw.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that you should do -- in the movie, there's more than a female character who has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid than so much --  Okay?  All right?  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things between each other.
It happens. I have seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality film -- Art.
Right? On Outlailing Russians, a success idea of what a quality Hollywood movie is.
Pretty much the test of Beijing.
And I don't think I should, because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in an ambassador where men and women hide during the crisis crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful conversations in this scale, and it's the great moment for one of the ants to take a look at the door and say, "You go to bed, carbon?
This is Hollywood.
So let's look at numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular movies, how many of them think they have female protocells?
You are not wrong.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's fine.
But there's a bigger number that is going to be disappointed this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted in his life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely silver, but when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think about is there is a lot of sexual agreed.
Who are those guys, what are those guys?
What do you do not do?
Are you looking at the story that you say that the role of a male hero is to defeat the glass with violence, and then to charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not speaking?
Are we embracing that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very alarming statistics and we want to prepare it.
We have tools to our disposal as a power parking, and we hope that it helps but I have to ask, "How is it going to be able to protect you, at the same time, active or physically, are we educating our children to keep their power power?
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of shoulder.
Machinery definition is radically changing.
You'll have read about how new economy is changing the role of home and advantage.
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character was from "Star Wars. Do you know what I say?
Observation?
Obama, Kenya and German.
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories that I say to my son, and I see and fight only and more stories where his job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the OECD magician.
Thank you.
As a child, I lived in Maine, and one of the things I liked most was looking for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these contracts.
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see it.
However, over time, I used to look for it.
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me collaborate me.
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of past and architecture.
And finally when I started studying educational school, I realized that I would see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach on Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles of length alongside the Niger.
And my sea cookies had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew that I had to do in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use infrared information.
This is a place located in the eastern pain of Egypt called Benjamin.
And the place, in the naked eye, it seems to be brown -- but when we use infrared and we process it using false color, suddenly the place looks like bright robot.
What you're seeing are the actual chemical changes of landscape caused by the building materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptians and the activity.
I want to share with you how we've used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city, called Iranian, lost for thousands of years.
It was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the Ford -- Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of the ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.
The Egyptians have always known that Italian was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that built them, indicated inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge plant plant.
This area is enormous, it's about 6,000 dollars for 4,000 miles.
Before, the Nigeria is right next to the Arabic side, and as it changed over time, it was moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city self-assembly in an extensive landscape?
Trying to find random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a password, with the eyes sold and using baseball glaciers.
So we used NASA online data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
We could see where the NSA cold.
But you can see more determinism, and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we think could be the Ugender location.
So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists doing samples of sample, you can see it here.
When I say shown, it's like the tablets of sample in ice, but instead of climate change layers, we look for layers of human occupation.
Five feet down, underneath a thick gray layer -- we found a dense layer of central objects.
This means that in this possible location of Canada, five feet down, we have an illusion layer from several hundred years that are going to go from the Middle Empire -- exactly the same period that we think is Iranian.
We also found the jobs of fish, coral and cooking work, which proves that there was a jewelry workshop.
This might seem that it's not much, but when we think about the most common stones in the Middle Empire jewelry -- these are the stones that are used.
So we have a dense layer of occupation that data from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry workshop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find Arabic here, but let's go back to the place in a near future to locate it.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end up with my favorite quote in the Middle Empire -- I was probably written at Arabic 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all volumes.
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So apparently TED wasn't founded in 1984 C, C.
It makes ideas really happen in 1984 to C in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the search for marine spots in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's done.
Now visualize a group of obese numbers in bicycle.
They're competing in a biological race race and they go in the direction of their entry door.
I need this to look at this.
They're particularly paralyzed, they're coming up, they are going to save a lot.
And they collide against the door of his house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that go on to their side, radiation of the wheels that end up in abstract places, pass the door threshold.
So the window, the passenger, or what there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light.
You're waving them with your hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
They can feel their blue hair by doing shapes in the nose.
You can smell the oats. You can smell that you're about to get into the mouth.
They pass on the side and train their living room.
It's already in the room, and making a maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney Shanghai.
He's with a little bit of clothes, dancing on his center message, singing "Marcus.
Now I mean the kitchen.
The ground has been gathered with a path of yellow brick and from the oven come to you Down Down, the House of Holy, the Spanish and "The Magic of "The Many of OECD, grab the hands, jumping to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the Medical Sermonian Memory.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a scientific journalist -- waiting -- I suppose, that this was like the end of a substance of sanitations.
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different hygiene.
They were memorize hundreds of random numbers, looking at just once.
They memorized the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
I memorized entire poems in just minutes.
I compete to see who I could memorize with more quickly the order of a barrel of narratives.
And I thought, "This is incredible?
These people must be physical phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Court who had come from England and he has one of the best metals of the memories.
I said, "You know, when you realize you're a guy?
He said, "I'm not a skin.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participated from this competition says they have normal memory.
"We have trained us to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some ancient techniques, invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used City to memorize their speech, and that medieval academics used to memorize the whole books.
And my reaction was, "You know, how did I not hear this before?
We were standing outside the hall of the competition, and Ed, who is a wonderful and brilliant English English, although a little exception, he said, "You know, you're an American journalist.
You know Britney Schumbas?
And I said, "What? No, why?
"I would like to teach Britney School how to memorize the order in a live bar of living novels, national television declines.
That would test the world that anybody can do it?
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney School, but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
It ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also investigating, trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what its potential can be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called E.
He's anticipated, very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that he didn't even remember that he had a memory problem, it's amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic -- but it was a window that allowed to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim Peter. It was based on Durawer Hollywood paper in the movie "The Man.
We spent a afternoon together in the public library of Salt Lake City, memorize phone books, was central.
And when I came back, I read a number of treaties about written memory something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in Antarctica, and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of memory trained, disciplined and growing wasn't such a rare thing as you can look at today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world possible, but they also changed us.
They have changed culture, and I would say that they have changed as well.
As we don't have any need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained memory, disciplined and cultivate is this kind of synthetic competition of memory.
It's actually not that symbolic, there's competition like this around the world.
I was fascinated -- I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from the University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
Would you want to know that it has brains in some way, structural or an analogous different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they smarter than the rest?
They gave them a battery of cognitive tests, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the control subjects of control to compare them.
When they put them in a magnetic MRI machine, they scanned their brains as they memorize numbers and faces and forms of snow, they found that in memory champions lit parts of the brain, different than others.
They actually use it, or they seemed to use, a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The torpe of competitive memory is made as an armed career where every year appears someone with a new way to remember more things, faster, and then the rest of competitors must be put a day.
This is my friend Ben Prison, three times a memory.
In his desk in front of him, there are 36 barriers of deaths that he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he dominated.
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of 41 random binary digits.
Yes. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways of remembering things in these competition, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end will be reduced to a single concept that psychologists call "decliner.
It illustrates with a parallel elegant electron known as the Paradise Parkinson's -- "The New Thing, I tell two people who remember the same word. I say to you, "Do you think there's a man named Bang."
That's his loss.
And then I said, "I think there's a "battle."
And when I came back later, and I asked them to say, "Did that word I told them a missing."
"Do you know what it was?
The person who was told that his name is Banglade is unlikely to remember the same word that the person he was told that his work is "slip."
Same word, different capacity to remember, that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the Bali name doesn't really mean anything for you. It has no relationship for you.
I remember all the other memories that they dance for their head.
But the word "All -- "Wow! We know pandemics.
They use a little white hat.
They have hard in the hands.
They smell well when they go home to work.
We probably know some panel.
And when we took that word for the first time, we began to put an association to make them easier to make them easier at some time.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this data is two years ago in the ancient Greece.
It's known as the "basemet.
The story is like this: There was a poet called Simon who attended a bank.
They had hired it as entertainment, because before before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you don't go to a DNA, you hire a poet.
He stood on his feet, he picks her memory poem -- and he walked away, and so soon he went out, the blood room collapsed itself.
It's all of them.
But not only killed them all, but they destroy the body bringing out immune.
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So you could not bury the bodies.
A tragedy behind the other.
Similarly, standing outside, unique survivor, in the middle of the rubble -- closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, he could see where he had been sitting every winter.
I took the family of his hand to take her to where their loved ones were between the rubble of them.
What Simon fits at that moment is something that we all know more or less interpretatively, and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or phone numbers or words for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and space memory.
If you ask me to pick up the first 10 words that I just told you about Simonythick, it's very likely to be very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who was sitting on the horse passenger horse in his lobby, they would be able to violence.
The idea of memory palace is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and you can think of images with the things that you want to remember -- the more local, the low, the local and the approach is the image, the more innovative it will be.
This is a advice that comes from more than 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, in Latin, on the ground.
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and they want to do a talk and they want to make it memory, the same way they had done City if they were invited to Technology about 2,000 years ago.
What they could do is imagine they're on the door of their house.
And I would know some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy and innovative to help me remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely inspired competition.
And then you can imagine coming into your house, and you see the monster of the Galapagos mounted on Mister Ed.
And that reminded them that they want to introduce their friend Ed County.
And then I would see Britney Shanghaist to remind that funny anecdote that they want to count.
And then they went into the kitchen, and the fourth topic that I would talk about would be that strange journey they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how the Roman speakers memorize their speech, no word for the word, which is going to confuse them, but typical by typical ...
In fact, the term "slip, comes from Greek "The Green "Come -- which means "computer."
It's when people thought about the origin and the rhetoric with this kind of space terms.
The phrase "The first place, it would be like the first place in your memory palette.
I saw this was just fascinating and I got to fill in that.
I went to some of these memory competition, and I had the idea of writing something extinct about this subsidial of competitive memory.
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a politically boring event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting on taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is killing the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put it in its place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem, or the names of a former school car bought in a lung market.
And I discovered that this was surprisingly entertaining.
I would have expected it to be.
It was entrepreneurial, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What is actually trying to do is better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these ridiculous images, comics and protections, inspirations, analysis and influence in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my team training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of products and a few security goggles left by just two adventures, because the distribution is the worst enemy of a memory competition.
I ended up going back to the same contest I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could come in, in a kind of participatory journalistic experiment.
I thought this could serve for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the competition -- something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize speech, and phone numbers and company lists, but actually this is not the point.
These are just trick, tricks that work.
Because it's based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And it is not necessary to be able to build members of memory or memorize noises of narratives, to benefit with a little bit of personality about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it comes to an innate donation, but it's not the case.
Great memories are educated.
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
We remember when we concentrate ourselves deeply.
The passenger parents. These memory techniques, they're just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even real rights.
They work because they make us work.
They run a kind of deep processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of us don't have to exercise out there.
But the reality is that there's no store.
That's how things make memories.
And if there is something that I want to leave you today is what E: The ambition I couldn't even remember that had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short existence in the Blackets or iPhone, not paying attention to being human in front of us, who walks on our side, will we be so honest that we don't even bother in process in deep."
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a memorable life, you must be the kind of person who remember remembering it.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we're going to leave just a complex place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from No Jersey, I was six years old and lived there at my parents' home in a village called Liberia, and this was my child's bedroom.
On the corner, from my bedroom. I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the room to be.
And there they all spend the rat looking at the telly -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody looked at me, and every time I get off, and I would come back into a towel. Everybody saw me.
And I was like that.
It was torture, insecure and hated it.
I hated that journey, hated that ball, hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and of division of zones, but from those visceral connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we use.
And it's not surprising that we sit in that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they're eventually, they think about "slip, "slip, and "slips?
And I know you think about it for based on a built building 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a waste that architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's a predictable emotional connection, we've used this trick for much, much time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
Look, these stable soldiers, solid substances, front of the side of the elements.
This is very, very useful because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who build the industrial and the governments, they always have fear to innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we met buildings like this.
It's a nice building.
It's the Public Library of Liberia that was ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a dome -- it has this kind of reduction, columns -- red shrimp, that let it enter what Liberia is trying to communicate with this building, the kids, the property values -- the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, another library was over, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to get together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings both called libraries are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the solid.
On one side there is innovation, architects that are constantly pushing new technologies, new titles, new solutions for today's life.
We push it and we push it so much, that we are completely removed from people.
All black, this depressed us, you think we feel very well, but we're dead inside because we don't have another option.
We have to go on the other side and go back to connect with those astronomers approached.
So we do it, and we're all happy, but we feel like translators. So we started to experience again, we do the back of the back going forward, over and over again. We've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago we went out in the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called "slides.
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
Small windows on a decentralized scale.
Something really hard.
So we came up to '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We push the pill back in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and accelerations.
We add baby and add cake and use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give it approach.
We take Chinese long-terms and turn them into resistances, which can be medieval changing made of glass.
The shapes were going to be walked, they won in audacity and color.
The engineers became columns.
Stories grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the rat in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there, in the suburbs we can create our own architectural fantasy.
Those fantasy could be the medicine, the French or the Italian.
Maybe with a synapty of bread sticks.
This is what happens with pollution.
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we remember memories from other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the Tomberin.
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we start making the focus back in the other direction.
In the '80s, and in the early '80s, we started experimenting with the called the resilient call.
We downloaded the historical symbols, we now count new design techniques running by computers, and we found new compositions, some ways that are star against other forms.
This is academic and emotional, and it's super improvisation. One is totally excluded.
Usually the child pill again in opposite direction.
But then, something amazing happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the Bill Bangalore, from Frank German.
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul Governor said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when criminals and academic and public in general, they were completely according to a building.
The New York Times City capitalists this minimum construction.
The tourism in Bilbao increased in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those buildings, Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Sarah.
Everybody wanted one, and Germany was everywhere.
He was our first star architect.
But how is it possible that these forms and wild and radical ways, how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media would spend around them, and we quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same thing did the major mayor of the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of beginning of the new millennium, happened with other stars.
He went to Zap and Leonardo, and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started going through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think of it, for example, how to consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transport is accelerating, you can take a ship -- an airplane can be tourists.
The technology accelerated -- you can see in the newspapers, on the web, and at the end, all of us are photographers of architecture, and the building will be transported beyond its physical location.
Architecture is everywhere now, that means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It's not a long time to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before I know what I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we meet buildings like this.
Brown was not a two-year-old movement but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much they had it.
That's never going to happen, I think, because we're in the threshold of the greatest revolution in architecture from the invention of the ant or steel or angle, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the aggression to the media of communication, it starts to flow faster and faster, until it will be in both extremes almost in the simulation, and it becomes effectively the difference between innovation and symbol between us, the architects, and you know, the public.
Now we can do almost instant symbols with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were hired to replace this building that came up.
This is the center of a village called Pennsylvania in the state of New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building was over, it was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the way, there was no surprise.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started getting and shared in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, they're the images that you made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes the collective memory. And when you charge these symbols.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of Liberia.
If that building is built today, first we go to the Internet in search of "the libraries.
We would be bombarded with examples of experiments, of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's manifestation.
Muslims who can lead to the mayor of Liberia, to the people in Liberia, and tell them that there's no unique answer to what can be a library today.
We are part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experiencing it.
Everything is different now.
architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use wonderful words and complicated drawings -- and you're not a desperate audience that doesn't accept anything that hasn't seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't leave you by architecture.
That means that the dark location of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find appropriate solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the building buildings will be very different than the buildings of today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of Security can be unique and adapt to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, it can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad historical imitation of red brick in ideas of what it should be a stadium.
This means that some robots can build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings are attributed to nature from nature and not the other.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make sports or for a sheet, or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East East East East of New York City, and to raise half a million dollars of the entire community around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little penguin pavilion -- as musical as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot that builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build it, what matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make more ecological buildings, more intelligent, more smart.
We've been waiting for all of you want to want it.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.
Find an architect, hire them and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play in play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the smallest spaces, local libraries -- the home where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my niece, Striking.
I just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that great, typical way of the children of a year, and they were actually actually actually moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally beautiful.
And one of the things that I like to do at the time is to look at the mirror.
She really loved his reflex.
She is laughing and childhood, and he gives himself those big and high beaches.
It's beautiful.
And apparently all of their friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and he made me think, when do I stop doing this?
How is it that suddenly we're not going to taste with our lineage?
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google, "I'm formula?
This is Faine, it's 13 years old and lives in Denay.
And as any teenager -- it just wants to be loved and focus.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little scary. It's a little bit confused because, although his mom tells him all the rat that's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
Between what his mom tells him and what his friends, or companies from school tell him, don't know who to believe.
So he does a video of herself -- he published it on YouTube, and he asked others to please leave a comment, "I'm nice or am I forget?
Well, so far, Facebook has received more than 13,000 comments over.
Some of these are so delicate, they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy teenager, normal and current teenager, which receives these responses in one of the stages of their life most emotionally vulnerable.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their majority teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are you doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, choose, giving them a little bit -- committed, sharing, publishing -- this never ends.
Never before we've been so connected before, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in your room every night.
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are implanted.
This environment, of being connected, is attached to our children to adjust based on the number of "I like it, that they have and the kinds of comments they get.
There's no division between a life in line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is difficulty manipulation.
What is the most slowed thing in somebody's life in front of what is normal in a daily context?
And where are they looking for the inspiration?
Well, you can see the kind of images that are postcards of girls from the girls now.
So zero-sum models continue to dominate our speeds.
The traffic technique is now a routine now.
And trends like, "Springs, attractive, Saudi and electronic.
For those of you who discover it, it means prostate.
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people are.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the ones in the support stars of sports and the Roman singing stars.
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we're sure we want our children to grow healthy and be good individuals.
But in an obsessed culture, we are teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capacities and their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see a nice enough.
These are not trivial activity.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and as contraction to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in class debates -- avoiding in the classroom debate because they don't want to call attention for their physical aspect.
One in five are not attending classes at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the testing season, if you don't think you can see good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're sufficiently delightful, you will get a lower note to the average of your peers, who don't worry about it about it.
And this phenomenon has become generalized in Finland and the United States and China.
It becomes regardless of what these young young people.
So, so that it gets good of it, we're talking about how you see you, not about how you're really you.
The low self-esteem on your body is depressed the academic performance.
And it's also losing health.
The teenagers with a few self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, they participate in more no healthy diet than they can bring them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily influenced by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's why they make more risky, like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, dramatic diet, aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships at early ages and without protection and supernova damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not controlling it.
Women who believe they have over again, regardless of whether they have or they have no greater advantage rates.
Ten percent of women don't introduce a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way they see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
They release this potential is from interest to each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about it, it doesn't take you very far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first is that we have to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of good interviews -- not realizing the situation.
So we should make sure that the program that follows our children not only will have a positive impact but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas -- the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial parts for anyone to provide an education in body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental -- but we face this problem requires each of us that we take in the issue and we are a better model to follow by women and girls in our own lives.
The current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the appearance of our politicians in hair cuts or the size of your chest, or the size of your chest, or the success of a Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to begin to judge people so they are, not as they see.
We can all start doing it by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can choose people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when was the last time you had a mirror that was there?
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to truly change our culture, so that our children grow to value their entire person, valuing the individual, diversity, inclusion aging.
We have to put people who are actually making the difference in a period.
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out in the big screen because we only create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never going to be seen to be who they are, or reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who is in mind?
Her wife.
Her sister.
Her daughter ...
How do you should? Your friend, your friend?
It could simply be the woman who is two seats away, what would it mean for her if it was released from that automated voice in his interior, which was haunted by not having long legs -- more thin lines, a more flat signal, a more plantation signature?
What would it mean for her if we overcome this, and we would say removed to their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is catching us together.
But we teach our children the truth.
The trainers that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for who they are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
We include self-esteem in our schools.
We change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we worked together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small tricks of an age year of today, they become agents of serious change of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On November five in 1990, a gentleman named Lability Norway entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi Meal Karajan, the leader of Defense Luciva.
Now North And I initially declared it innocent, but it was pressure by other lower charges, in company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 icons from New York, including tunnels, synagogue and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans are frustrated by an FBI informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the 1912 bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't help us.
And later Neanderthal would be convicted for his participation in that appear.
Alberta Norwegian is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a Egyptian engineer, with a former American mother, a primary school teacher, between the two made all possible to give me a happy childhood.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam -- that very few Muslims, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, they don't need a lot to get to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all human groups, there is always a little fraction of people who are terrified so strongly to their convictions that think that you have to use all possible media for everybody to live like them.
A few months before the arrest was feeling with me and explained that in the last few weeks, he and some friends, had been going to train training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I went to the next day.
We got to the pool of the Santa that without knowing our group, it was spread by the FBI.
When I got to throw me out, my father helped me hold the risk in the shoulder, and I explained how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that I shot I gave the little orange light on the goal, and for all of all, especially me, the whole goal was in flames.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, he said, "The open.
Maybe a parent, a child.
And the comment produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
They saw in me, the same level of destruction that my father could cause.
Those people later would be convicted for putting a carbon with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking park of the North Trade Center, causing an explosion that killed six people and hostile to another 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them "the "beautiful?
When I was 19, I was already moved 20 times, that instability during my childhood didn't allow me to do a lot of friends.
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to somebody already was time to start and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class was often a victim of masters.
I set up secret my identity to avoid being the white, but it will be the new of the class, silence and recovery, was enough manipulation.
So most of the time that happened at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons, they didn't develop social skills, to say strikes -- to grow under factories, I wasn't prepared for the real world.
They educate me to judge people, based on arbitrary indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that you could test my thinking was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a private program where you participate in the National Convention Conservation, in Philadelphia.
My group focused on the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been victim of the killing much of my life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from diverse processes.
One day, towards the end of the convention, I discovered that one of the kids that we had done friendship was Jewish.
I took several days going out to light this detail and realized that there was no ancestor between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly, I felt very proud of being able to sell the barrier that all life had made me believe that it was an angle.
Another crucial moment came up when I got a summer work in Bush Gards, a diversity park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in developing my character.
All life had taught me that homosexuality was a sin and, by extension, all the farmers were bad influence.
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the greatest and less critical ones I had seen in life.
Having been accused of a child, developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat old people, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
And so I could contrast the stereotypes that had taught me of a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be honest, but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the "Do Shakespeare."
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be intellectually honest about my intelligence, and helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with the character.
In many ways, he became my favorite figure at a moment when I was desperately going to be.
In occasion, the inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedy would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, extracting, wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that I would carry on my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with someone who was tired of somebody who's suffered enough with strangers and said, "I'm tired of hate his open."
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hate in your inside.
My real name is not Zoor Electronic.
I changed it when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decide to go out and put it into a risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who was trying to lead to violence, can hear my story and understand that there is a better path, that even though I was led to this ideology violent and sophisticated, I didn't get to make it fantasy.
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, by the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism talking about those meaningless acts as a rejection to my father's actions.
So with this simplicity here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that children don't have to follow their parents' roads.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point there is a movie that's projected in their minds.
It's an incredible multimedia movie.
It's in 3D, and it has a sound sound of what you listen and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has a treatment, you know it and your text.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood who are projecting to your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed in your sense of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in direct direction.
This film is your awareness flow -- the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- you, you and you.
There's nothing we know more directly.
At least I know I have a conscious consciousness.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of consciousness, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we conscious?
Why do we have these internal movies.
Why are we not just robots that we process what we get to produce results without experiencing the international film.
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
It suggests that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
science, by nature, is objective by nature.
consciousness, by nature, is subjective.
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost every century, I predict that vision.
Psychology was studying obesity behavior. neuroscience studied the brain, obviously, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
Then, 20 years ago, everything began to change.
Neuroscience like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Penestonic said, "That's the moment for science to love consciousness.
And since then, there was a real explosion of a scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of corruptions, correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that Nancy Kanzi presented a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of corruptions.
It's not a science of explanations.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness -- the questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are correctly.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
No offense to neuroscience.
Actually, there are no easy problems with consciousness.
Well, I don't look at the central mystery of this matter, why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness."
Why is there an inner film film?
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's take a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like incomprisingly, like humilities, like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical subjects are all of the emerging behaviors, how the incessions operate -- how the hurricane works, how the hurricane works, how they reproduce and they adapt living organisms -- they're all questions about the objective work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an emerging phenomenon, how we talk, how we talk about, how we talk about how we are attached, they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is why is it that all behavior is accompanied from a subjective experience?
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the emergence -- the standard paradigm of neuroscience.
I'm a heart scientific material.
I want a scientific theory of preparation, which works. For a long time, I got my head on the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for systematic reasons.
I think we're going to stay at this point.
We have a chain of wonderful explanations -- great. We used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit on this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to embrace that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness, right now, is kind of a analogy, something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas -- I think we need ideas that are at the beginning to look crazy, before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennance, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the inner minimum movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
And actually, what you have to do, is to explain the objective functions -- the behaviors of the brain, and so you study everything that you need to explain.
Well, more power for him.
That is the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of the powerful consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to just deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfied.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be promised.
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
And physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental lunches, space, time and mass.
Postmarker fundamental laws that govern them, like gravity laws or quantum mechanics.
These fundamental laws and properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
On the contrary, you consider fundamentalists, and that's where the world is built.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is coming up.
In the 19th century, Marshall discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of very fundamental fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws -- so I set up the basic laws of the electronics, and it poses electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws government.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental fundamental ideas, space, time, mass -- then by a matter of logic, you have to hold your list.
The most natural thing would be to push consciousness itself as a fundamental lunch, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the path to contact scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass -- physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws that we can build them in a refrigerator.
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we look for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called pants, "Man, for all, "The for mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the flies, even the microbes of Rob King, the elementary particles.
Even a picture has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that the photons are smart or they think.
It's not that a picture can be full of angiogenesis when you think about it, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the rooms.
No, so no.
But the thought is that perhaps the photons can have some kind of raw feeling, subjective sense -- some primary precursor of consciousness.
This can sound a little bit crazy for you.
How do anybody think something so little?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is critical.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It is also worth notice that although the idea seems to us, although the idea seems to us, it's much less for the different cultures of different cultures where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that relate to thinking with the physical process, is to link awareness with information.
There are always information processing -- there's consciousness.
Complex interview processing, like a human being, complex consciousness.
Simple information, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, Girl Tony, took this kind of theory and development with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information, which is called scale, which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And I suppose it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of day, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration -- as significant as a very significant degree of consciousness pretty important.
But when you get to the landscapes, microbes, particles -- the head of the day.
The level of data integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In Tony theory, there will still be a level of different awareness.
In fact I propose a fundamental law of consciousness, high degree of six, high awareness.
Also, another reason is that the paradox can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies underneath.
As Stephen Hawking explained where the fire fire comes out.
So from the language of language the physics equations can be left as they are, but they can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describes the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not found outside of the physical world as a kind of administration.
It's right there in the center.
This vision, I think, the perspective vision, has the potential to transform our relationship with nature, and can have quite serious social consequences.
Some can be illustrative.
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, then I had to be vegetable.
If you're a performance and you accept that vision, you will have a lot of hungry.
I think I think well, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms and moral consequences, is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its complexity and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the Santa artificial intelligence system in the movie "Hey?
Is it conscious?
According to the vision of peaceful information, she has a complicated processing processing -- so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, you have a pretty serious ethical problems about the development of intelligent computer systems and the ethics of searching.
Finally, you can ask about the consciousness of full collective collective, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness."
Or at a more local level, an integrated group -- like the audience in a TED Talk, at this moment we have a TED collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the parts?
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that must take seriously.
So this paradox view, it's a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is fundamental than the second one that is universal.
Vision raises many questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness we know and love us.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we finally go to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile, a low education of education.
I went to school, I joined my friends, I fought my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came to my parents because I wanted to name for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She has not done anything --  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the "Mars Veronica Veronica, and "The Veronica Credit?
Yeah, I know. What contractions.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing you can consider as a achievement if we take the disability outside the equation.
Years later, it was in the second part of the teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 in the legal studies a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when do you give your speech?
And I said, "What diamonds."
Well, I had been talking about the law of division for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your motivation speech.
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about institutional things in school?
"For general in the activist room.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with people with disabilities.
And we are not. And it's not the guilt of the guy, that is true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our manufacturers.
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage like what I do in this wheelchair and you're probably waiting to inspire you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear decorations of a statistical.
I'm not here to inspire you.
I'm here to tell you that they've lied us in relation to disability.
Yes, they've sold us the lie that disability is a Bala -- Mars, many magnificent.
It's something bad and living with a disability makes you excited.
It's not a bad thing and I can't make it except.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social communication media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."
Or this one, "Your excuse is inventing?
Or this other one: "Before the open, income.
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be that you have seen one of the girl without hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child who ran with prosthetic legs of carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call porn inspiration.
And I use the term depressed term -- because of a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we encode the disability in benefits of people without disabled people.
The purpose of these images is to inspire them, motivate them, so we can see them and think, "Well, so bad what my life might be worse.
I could be that person.
But what if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've gotten strange to want to express you think that I am a brave or a source of inspiration -- and this is happening before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was happy to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is completely.
These images, those images match people with disability in benefit of people without disabled people.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually something difficult.
We have a few things.
But the things we know are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term "designership, deliberately because I was struck by called the social model of disability that tells us that we are more disabled because of society that we live that because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
It does the things that I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of its ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So is it really fair in the way we do that, by sharing those pictures?
When people say, "You're a source of inspiration -- it tells you as a completely.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie -- because you've sold this lie that disability makes us exciting.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here biomass the inspiration -- and you think, "Oh God, Steve, aren't you sometimes inspired by something?
And actually, I know I am.
I learn from other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't learn that I'm more lucky than them.
I learned that this is a great idea to use a little bit of barriers to pick up the things that go down.  I learned the ingenious trick of how to load the battery from the mobile phone in the chair.
Great.
We learn from the strength and resilience of others, not against our bodies and our diagnostics.
I really think that the lie that have sold us about disability is the biggest invitation.
It makes us hard life.
And that quote, "The only disability in life is a bad attitude, the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a pile of stairs has never done that it becomes a date.
Never          Samat before a television screen will not make the subtitle for deaf people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and dragging a positive attitude to turn all those books into the broken.
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl, sitting in his bedroom watching "The Vermeer Standard, don't consider anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we are happy to lift up from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genetic achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a 11th degree kid in a high school school in McDonald's is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair users.
Disability doesn't make us excited, but question what you believe to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to look at augmented reality and professional floor, with empathy.
And what's the average speed of a non-zero-sum player."
Unfortunately, today only answer one of those questions, so please don't get away.
When people think about augmented reality, they think of "Look Report, and in Tom Crutification putting hands in the air, but the augmented reality is not science fiction.
The augmented reality is something that will happen in our days and happen, because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because the augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phone.
So how do we get to the augmented reality?
The first step, is what drives post-organized, the Google Glass.
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that the Google Germs are a device that allows them to see what I see.
And let me tell you what it is to be a professional sports in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to describe it.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you will fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what's running through the game field to 100 miles, the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a 120-year-old man shows us, trying to leave them with all of it.
I've been there and I assure you that it's nothing nice.
So I brought some videos to show you what is using the Google Glass under the helmet and giving you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the NGOs practice, because the idea of the NGO of emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris Kait: Go.
It's horrible to be said.
A moment. Let's take a little bit.
You ready?
Go!
Chris Kale: As you can see, it's a proof of what is being kidnapped in the football field, from the period of the sport.
You may have realized that they lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them from the University of Washington.
Field, Randies 54,000 mice 54.
Blue 8, Blue #2: Go!
Chris Kaite, this is a little bit more to the feeling being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being at NASA.
The fans want that experience.
Faces want to be in the field, being their favorite players, and they've asked me on YouTube and on Twitter, and you can see from the angle of a field of field.
or a right?
We want to experience that?
Once we have that experience with GDP and Google Glass, how do we get out of filled? How do we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called Essen Rice, which is surely a lot of you know.
The Rift Rio has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not a cheap word.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh oh.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep playing playing? No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
CK: That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain taking for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when we recorded a video from Adrianne Peter crossing the line, defending a tangible with the arm before running and doing an analogy, which will be the experience of a fancy.
When I can be Media running around the car, I would launch the ball at the bottom of the network, or Female doing a shell in Burning."
What will be their experience when it comes from a mountain to over 100 miles like an Olympic scarce?
Maybe the sales will increase for adults.
But this is not still augmented reality.
It's just virtual reality, RISD.
How do we reach the augmented reality, ROM:
We will achieve the augmented reality when the commercials, the mentors and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our teams?
How do we use it to win parties?
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here is a brief report about technology at NASA.
In 1965, Barbara Palestinians put a marine to their field marine to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to imitate them.
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the NGO puts radio in the fields of the field marketing and then in the defense.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In 2013, imagine that you are a player going back to your group and you see their next toy shown in front of you, in a plastic vision that takes a chance. You don't have to worry about forget a game.
Or to memorize strategy.
They just go out to the field and react.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parasites, and they hate to lose parties.
If you lose parties you get it up as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just an improved strategies.
So augmented reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium, having a view from how high people are down.
You also get information from the care sensors and the accelerations, something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know to send it.
The bad ones will have survived information.
This difference the good teams of evil.
So your team of computing will be as important as your reports, and the data analysis will stop being just for nerves.
Who would have imagined it?
How would it be in the country?
Imagine the field of field.
You get the balance and you go back.
You look at an open receptor. All of a sudden, a fluid on the left side of your bombsight is that a defense behind you are going to attack you. Normally, you don't see it, but the river system is drawn up.
It advances.
Another fluid added you there is an open receptor.
You throw the ball, but you get rid of you.
And the balance loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in their bombsight an area of grass that lights and can modify the career.
They approach, they attract the ball, run and angry.
The public and the fans have followed the game from each angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion on the game.
I'll make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field.
They want to be their favorite player.
The augmented reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of augmented reality.
Are we going to use it just as bread and circus as our usual entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for sports lights.
It generates billions of income per year.
But how much this technology is doing for a teacher in the classroom trying to show an agent how dangerous their actions are from the perspective of victims?
How much this technology is for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how to be constantly."
How much is it also for a Commandment Halley or a Neil Density Thomas trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of tears and Karanines, instead of tears and Karanines."
Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face and the challenges that we face, as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently retired me after 23 years of service at the California Path of California.
Most of those 23 years of my country was spent by the southern end of the Marine County, which includes the Goldman Gate bridge.
The bridge is an iconic structure, known by its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Goldman Gates bridge was open in 1966.
Joseph Stewarts, the head engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically in the test of suicide.
The suicide from the bridge is not practical nor probably?
But from his openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that they travel between the two towers to bring them to another dimension -- this bridge has been ideology as such, so that the fall of it releases you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a four to five seconds, the body hit the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact broke bone, some of which you perceive vital organs.
Most of them die in the impact.
Those of us, normally additional in the ocean water and then shooting.
I don't think that those who contain this method of suicide is realizing the death male that they face.
This is the wire.
Except about two towers, there are 32 paradise steel streams to the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to take their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is in that edge, and in its darkest moment, it's very hard to bring it back.
And I took this picture last year while this young man talked to an officer contemplating his life.
I want to tell you that we had success that day to bring it back on the barrier.
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
We fought to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who held the suicide, but the officials as well.
We've got a long way since then.
Today, versions and psychologists train the new offices.
This is Jason Garden.
I met him on July 22 last year when he received a call from a possible suicide subject sitting in the coal near the center.
Respect, and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an official of the Goldman Gate.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, I had flown up here two times before the New Jersey to try to support it from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to Jason -- we asked if we knew the story of the Pandora's box.
Remember Greek mythology Zero created Pantheon, and he sent her to the Earth with a box, and he said, "No, never open that box.
Well, one day, curiosity could more than Pandering, and she opened the box.
From she came out, pink, and all kinds of bad things against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no hope."
He stopped a few minutes away, he leaned on the right, and he left.
This nice, clever girl in New Jersey just saved his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see how it was.
Jason parents had asked it.
Super suicide damage affect a lot of people.
Let me pose you these questions: What do you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved out surgeons?
What would you say?
You know what to say?
In my experience, you don't just talk about, but you have to listen.
Listen to understand.
Don't argue, culture, or tell the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't know.
They're just there, you can be the inflection point they need.
If you think someone is suicide, you don't have fear of teaching and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is, "Are you in similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life, you've had these thoughts?
They will confront the person in front of the front and be the point of influence for them.
Others are looking for it, despair, believing things are terrible, and they're never going to improve it, impossible, believe there is nothing you can do about it, recent social isolation, and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read her letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and bless that I read them.
"Oh, Kevin -- I imagine you're at TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave a note.
I hope you can tell many people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite insecure, but I'm noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from Pittsburgh to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 with his father on January 19.
Never came there.
I called the police of Peter and I reported it as a disappear that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that Mike car was down in the bridge.
A witnesses had seen it jumping from the bridge at 1,500 percent of the late day.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight themselves.
Who hasn't been before wrong without having a real mental disease."
It shouldn't be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with me for your fight.
The GPS Bridge Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery commercial.
Good luck this week, Video:
I can't imagine the value that she needs to go to the bridge and walk the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005 responded to a radio call for a possible suicide subject on the side of the bridge near the north tower.
I led my bike, and I looked at this man, Kevin Bernard, standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the barrier, and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and half the next time, I heard about Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided that day will come back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, the happiness.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what made it come back and give the hope and the life and the other opportunity?
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You hear it.
I let me talk and just listen to me.
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother in Kenya, and I have that letter with me, and I'd like to read you.
"Dear Mr. British nothing will erase the events of the 11th, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was talking about aid.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness that has been properly meditating.
I adopted Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those tracking traits -- but thanks to God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
So honestly, in debt with you, Narrator Berkeley.
And at the end she wrote, "Oh, when I visited San Francisco General that night, you would figure out like the patient.
"I know I had to fix it."
Today, Kevin is a carbon father and an active member of society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and his depression with hope that his story inspire others.
The suicide isn't just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was suicide with poison.
That act, despite the end of your own pain, I broke the opportunity to meet me.
This is what the suicide does.
For most of the suicide people, or those who consider the suicide, they didn't think about scratch another person.
They just want their own pain to end.
Typically, this is only in three ways, sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and suicide calls around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been directly involved in, I've just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was Jason one.
The other was a man who was talking about an hour.
During that time, I shook my hand in three times.
At the end of the end, he looked at me, and he said, "Look, I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And I jumped out.
Horrective, absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact that bridge is not suicide.
In addition, those few who have jumped out of the bridge, and they lived and they can talk about it, that one or two, most of those people have said that the second one who leaves the railing realized they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I say to people, the bridge not only connected Mary with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or bridges that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be striving to do.
The suicide can prevent you.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you know what you are, but in your interior, you know what you are, and one question frame. How do you become that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had from a child.
My foreign finally connects with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, I will be referring to me later, when I look at this picture, I think, the Gene get it, you get it, you get it.
But the past October, I discovered that, well, I'm starting to go.
We all understand our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value to release it, to get rid of the limitations imposed by the color of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
These are people who always defy the status quo -- which is considered accepted.
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent even -- I ignored my story.
I think this side is called revolution.
This is mine.
They recorded me as "I am born because of the appearance of my genius.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my home, I always took this t-shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always take that t-shirt in your head?
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a girl.
I knew then how to add it.
Generation has always considered an immune fact, but now we know that, actually, it's something more complex and mysterious at all.
Because of my success, I never dare to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be bad, but how the world deals with those of us who want to release them.
Every day I appreciate being woman.
I have mom and Dad and a family that accepted me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist god of compassion.
There's a Hindu god goddess of the floors.
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Philippines who celebrated these mysteries here.
I was in front of the stage, and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something hit me, this is the kind of woman I wanted to be.
And when I was 15 years old, I was still wearing this woman called TED.
It's the director of a conversation of beauty belief.
That night she said, "Why haven't you participate in the beauty consumption?
He told me that if she was involved in the steps of insulin and training costs, and that night, he won in a bathroom suit, and he won the gallon suit and he had a third shot between more than 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was from the queen of women translated, but I can.
I also met the gods, especially when we traveled to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001, my mom who had moved to San Francisco, called me and told me that I was carrying my green card request that I could go live to the United States.
I was resistant to me.
I said to my mother, "Mommy, I'm fun.
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen beauty?
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know if you move to the United States you can change the name and the identity of genome?
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I put two to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was operating in Thailand at the age of 19, too.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most present surgery, sophisticated and safe.
So in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before we change the name and the gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the George name and the Gene of female gender.
It was a big moment.
For some people, their identity of identity means to be able to drive or be able to get a job, but for me it was the license to live, to feel money.
Suddenly, my fears were minimizing.
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of mine Albert Nets.
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but he would destroy her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
Every 20 of November, we do a global video by the Denay Congress of the Translation.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who stood and stood in front of injustice.
These are Mary P. Johnson and Sylvia Richard.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and only for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame.
I'm here, exposing it, so that someday there is no more vibration in November 20.
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  KT: General, a quick question.
George Robert: Sure. See, first of all, thank you all my benefits.
For my parents, my parents especially to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've attended young women -- I had eating, and sometimes when I was called me and told me that their parents couldn't accept it. I took the phone, called my mom and said, "Mom, can you call this woman."
Sometimes it worked, others don't. It's just a gender identity, that's what's at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us are assigned by a gender at birth, and what I try to do is put on the table that some times that assistance is not block, and that there should be a space that allowed the English people, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The transportation movement is committed to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work for doing.
It should have understood it.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Thank you. GG: Thank you.
In many patriarchal and tribal societies to parents are usually known by their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known by their daughter and I'm proud of it.
Malawi started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007, and when his efforts were bombed in 2011, he was aware of the National Prize of peace, he became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of innovation, of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in patriarchal societies, right from the beginning, when a child is born, his birth doesn't celebrate.
It's not good, not for her father, not for her mother.
The neighborhood comes into the mother and no one happy to the father.
And a mother was overwhelmed for having a girl.
When I give birth to the first child, the first daughter, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, he contains, and with the hope of a son, when he builds his third daughter, he feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the mother suffered -- but the daughter -- the daughter is going to be born -- when it grows, it sounds too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays at home and school to admit to their siblings.
Up until the age of 12 way, it has a good life.
You can have fun.
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when I go into the teenager, when I was 13 years old, it comes out of your house without a male.
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
He becomes the name of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he was to transfer the code of that honor honor, he could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this course code of honor, not only affect the life of a boy, also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, sacrifice the joy of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a normal norm of the patriarchal societies called obesity.
A good girl must be very quiet and very humble and very surrounded.
It's the criticism.
The model of a good girl must be cancer.
It's supposed to be silent and make decisions of your father and your mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if you don't want.
If the house with a man who doesn't like or if the married with an old man, it has to accept it, because it doesn't want to be a delivery subject.
If the very young house has to accept it.
Otherwise, they call it depression.
And what happens at the end?
In the words of a poet, "The house, the end, and then gives birth to more children and daughters?
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, increased the same lesson for his daughter and the same honor of honor to his children.
And this vicious circle goes on and on.
Hard brothers and sisters -- when Malay was born Malay, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newly names, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt pretty honored to me.
And so long before I was born, I thought of his name, and he was fascinated with a legendary fight of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was Malaria from Malawa, and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I looked at me, everybody was men, and I grabbed my pen, and I brought a line from my name, and I wrote, "That's "slip?
And when she grew up, when she was four and a half years old, I would admit it in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to mention it.
You can give it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of girls.
Instituted in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
A school administration means that it's entered the world of dreams and hospitals where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be surprised, two weeks before, when I was going to take the warming form of warehouse life, and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the attacks of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my writing written in any document.
That's why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or their daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the magic of my daughter.
I was able to sit with me when my friends came to me.
I encourage you to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to instill them in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for Malawi.
I've implemented all these good values in my school and kids alike.
It uses education for employee.
I taught my daughters, I taught students, to forget the lesson of obesity.
I taught students to forget the lesson of the School.
We wanted brothers and sisters, we fought for more rights for women, and we fought to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It's called the Tanzania.
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls were banned to go to school.
Women are forced to use veil, and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were silenced. The angles of the children and the singing songs.
They suffer millions, but a few of them, and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and rooftop when you talk about your rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, Malay got up and raised on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog, he offered herself for the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was sprayed as a clarity around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and the ninth of October 2012, he was shot to burn his head.
It was a failed day for my family and for me.
The world became a great black hole.
While my daughter was designed between life and death, he whispered her ear to my wife, "I am blaming for what happened to my daughter, your daughter?
And he said, "Please don't blame you."
Defense the right cause.
You put your life in play by the cause of truth, because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter is inspired in you and you join you.
They were both in the right path and God they protected?
These few words mean a lot for me, and I didn't ask a question again.
When Malay was in the hospital and had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was extended by my wife's face.
But my daughter never complained, right?
I used to say, "I'm okay with my Turkish smile, and with the excitement in my face.
I'll get good. Please don't worry.
It was a consumer for us, and we were convinced.
dear brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist at the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children and women and women -- it's like any 16 year-old girl.
I cried when you don't end up your task.
You fight with your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my tutor that has done so audacious to Malay so brave and express and energy?
I say, don't ask me what I did.
Ask what I didn't do.
I don't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was operated from the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the brain science has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineer.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Moore's group of Google, where I've had a division to my cart, the division of Google X, but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside my work there.
Having said that, there is a stigma when you lie to an operation of brain.
Are you still like intelligent or not?
If you don't be like that, you can be intelligent?
After the neuroscientist, I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and neuroscience.
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what number you would take, from more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if you didn't take anything, you die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and microbes of chemicals, and try to get them to try to get them, to follow with life.
More than once I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul, so I decided that I was going to experience to try to get the optimal doses because there's really not a clear map that says it in dominant.
I started testing with different microscopes, and I was surprised by seeing how small changes in the doses changed my authority, my sense of who I was, my way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly impressive case for a few months, I tried a little bit and typical chemicals for a seat man, and I was surprised by seeing how my thoughts changed my thoughts.
I was always fundamentalism, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and                                               
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be arresting.
In fact, I was trying to be a lot of insecurity, to fix a problem that had the front, and it just doesn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my designs.
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation about men and about what they have to go through.
What I was trying to do, by adjust those hormones and neuroscientists and so forth, was to recover my intelligence after disease and operation, my creative thinking, my idea of ideas.
I tend to think about it almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how to get those mental images that I used to create prototypes, my ideas, if you want to get new ideas and pick up situations.
This kind of thinking is not new.
Philosophers like Humble and Destructs and Hindu see things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are those who are questioning this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple, for most of us, mental images are fundamental for creative and invention thinking.
So after several years, I was able to find the point right and I have lots of great mental members -- really virus, well sophisticated and good structure.
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images, my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what happens if a movie director was able to use its imagination only to steer the world that has the front?
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can be shared at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments done by two groups in neuroscience.
You both use the RNA technology, image for functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan done by Gill Gandhi and his Harvard colleagues.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you imagine, looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created by solving the contents of the central column on the left on the left -- you see that the difference is almost now.
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same image is almost now.
Now, let me share another experiment. This is from Jack Galvan lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert the brain waves into recognition.
Put it this way.
In this experiment, he showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were scanning their brains to create a lot of brain reactions to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and while a new scan was recorded.
The computer, using just the brain information of the scan to figure out what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the computers of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
And this left us.
We're pretty close to achieving it.
We only need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image, and when you imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same magic.
This led to the brain scanning brain scanning systems available today, and its resolution is increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we get it?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes to it.
I don't know that for that.
Many of them are proposing new techniques of projections for images, even me, telling us with the recent result of the MRI first, we need to ask the following: this technology will be the end of the way?
conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, more grain magnets only offer small improvements in the resolution, not for thousands of them as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of larger magnets -- let's make better magnets better.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different backgrounds, like doing a spread.
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a lot of effort in the MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most of the recent advances in sort of sort of interrelative and brilliant solutions in construction and decoration, in the transmission and receptors of radio radio frequency in the MRI systems.
At the same time, instead of a macro magnetic field, we used magnetic patterns strengthened to the FM radio frequencies surrounded.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the French radio frequency processing patterns, we can increase the information that you can extract in one scale.
In addition, we can then divide our knowledge in layers of the structure of brain and memory to create increases in the thousands we need.
By using HIV we should be able to measure not just the fluid of oxytocin. But the of the hormones and the telecoms that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity -- this is sleep.
We will be able to fly our ideas directly to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move over the language and communicate directly by thinking about it?
What would we be done?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without filter?
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the Alzheimer's cure and disease.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, take a year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it would take much more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you this night about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not only gay carbona.
I think we all have arrangements.
Their charge may be telling some person for the first time that loves it or telling someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have to do in life.
Everything is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary tremendously. The experience of having lived and out of that armed is universal.
Day fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked at the South War Wall Cather, a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the medical medical intensity -- I didn't go through my armpits -- I quote the letters of Al da France as a legislature.
And I'm going to be aware that by the Dutch of my short pants and having embraced my head a little bit, I would ask a little kid, "Hey, are you a kid or girl?
And there was an uncomfortable silence on the table.
I was going to get my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a rain left.
The horrible father increases the newspaper and the mother would launch a cold look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and I would smell it inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised that next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"Do you have a guy or a girl?
A family silence, but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues on the table.  I had the quote of Betty Francisco.
Gloria Standard quote.
Even a snippet of the "computers of the vagina, that I showed you.
And so I was breathing the monkey and I looked at it and my own four year-old girl with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist sleep, just a girl with a question: "Are you boys or girl?
So I would breathe back a little bit about it, and I got on claps near it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confused.
I have the short hair like a child, and I see a kid, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable painting.
Well, I'm more like a comfortable painting.
And that girl looked at me, paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pyramid is video and has a fish.
Can you give me a parking, please?
And that's it. Just "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the patient I asked?
It was the most easy conversation of everybody who's ever had.
And why? Because the girl of the partner and I, both of us were honest with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some of us in my life, and yes, often my walls used to be a rainbow.
But within the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how you feel living in a closet.
That's how my charity is not different than yours or yours or you.
Sure, I will give you 100 reasons why going out of my closet, it was harder than out of it, but this is the thing: The hard is not relative to it.
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell someone who would tell someone who has been declared in a rock bank is harder than saying that it's been standing?
Who can tell you that this story is more difficult than telling your five year-old than you're going to divide?
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop celebrating what is hard to do with respect to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our learners and we need to only feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in arms, and they can make it feel security, or at least safer than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, no matter what their walls are, a crazy army is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine itself 20 years ago.
I had a horse tail, a stone and street shoes shoes.
It wasn't the military lesbian prepared to fight any four year-old child who went into the coffee.
I was frozen by the fear of the fear of my dark closet, pushing my gay graphic, and moving only one muscle is the most strange thing that I've ever done.
My family, my friends, complete strange strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not decide, and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't launch that big, I'll kill you.
One of my most memorable recording launches was in my sister's wedding.
It was the first time that many of the guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my honor laboratories in my black dress and songs, I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me about years ago.
And after I'm talking about a moment, one of the women would say, "So named Nathan Law."
And the gay story battle had begun.
"Have you ever in the County?
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San Francisco.
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's fantastic."
"Oh, you know my Arabia statistics?
It's very good and never talked about having neighborhood?
"Oh, what is your favorite TV program.
Our favorite program Will and Grand.
And you know who loves us? Jack later.
Jack is our favorite.
And then a woman, described, but instead of showing desperately his support, to make sure he was from my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses pink camps?
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the record landscapes.
Sure, it could have been easy to indicate where they felt less.
It's not really hard to find it and realize the fact that they were spent.
And what else can you ask someone, but to speak?
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for how much you get.
That's how hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have gone with.
But I'm getting better, and I know what I like to call the three principles of the Pantasia girl.
Now, please see this through gay perspective, but they understand that what it involves coming out of any arrow is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
You know the armed sandwich. Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no anger but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be genuine -- others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be a direction. Just give it out. You get your parks.
If you know that you're gay, you know.
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they would keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more importantly,  leave the complex.
You communicate their truth.
They are now apologize by that.
And some of them can come out of secure wounded hands, which they have done, but they never apologize for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel decisive, but that something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark shark pushing a graphic, you must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very lonely, but they're not.
Thank you, Boston. Enjoy the vehicle.
Intelligent, what is that?
If we look at the story of how intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous Stone Dip quote that "The question of if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be shifted."
When Edison Dip wrote this as a critical to the pioneers of computing as Alan Turing.
And so, a few years ago, I was able to start a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying the intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
First of all, we start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an alien race, which you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neurons of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as terrorists, we know the reason would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about the Earth's intelligence -- it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain point in time, the asteroids that would delay the surface of a planet mostly stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that you can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I analyzed a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that would be, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In cosmology for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be funded for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that maximize the diversity of future possible.
Finally, in robotic movement planning -- there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so, taking all these different issues and putting them together, I asked, for a number of years, there is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different issues.
Is there just an equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to one and a foot for the intelligence I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force, FBI, which acts with the end of maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices, with a T force, with the diversity of the future accessible future, yes, to an impending future time, as well.
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get stuck.
The intelligence tries to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain open options.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How productive is it?
Will I predict the level of human intelligence?
Is artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: Recent research in cosmology has suggested that the universes who produce more destructive, or "free, during their life should have trends to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that cosmological contemporary connection between entropy and intelligence is a deeper relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the long-term entropy production, but actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called England, designed to maximize the long-term entropy production in any system which is in the inside.
And amazingly, it was able to spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even earn money to trade action, all of that without that they had been able to do that.
Here are some examples of English in action.
Just like a hundred foot human, here we see England balancing automatically a pole using a cart.
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave an English goal.
He just decided to have his own balance balance.
This ability to balance will have applications for human robotics and human assistance technologies.
This capacity of tool uses applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate the tax of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that England can perform a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
International is widely applicable to a variety of domains.
For example, here we see it successfully playing a game game against itself, illustrate its potential for play.
So here we see England organizing new connections in a social network where friends are constantly disconnected and keeps successful net network.
This same capacity of network orchestra also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see England organizing the routes of a ship of ships, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, Internation is widely applicable to problems in autonomous and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see England spontaneously discovering and running a shopping strategy in a simulated series of action negotiation -- successfully increasing assets under its exponential management.
This risk management ability will have wide applications in finance and safe.
Alex Williams: What you've seen is that a variety of intelligent cognitive behavior marks such as tools use tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derived from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep irony here.
So we went back to the beginning of the robot, the work "The Reef worked, there was always the concept that if you develop smart machines, there would be a cyber rebellion of it.
The machines are lifted against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of cyber rebellion to investment.
It's not that machines first become smart and then magical and trying to get out of the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse of taking the control of all possible future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than being the reverse.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
I often ask me, how is it that looking for goals get rid of this kind of frame?
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants to help us build artificial intelligence, or to help us understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a point of inflection in human history, something between the confidence of stars and losing the planet that we call "discovery."
But in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The NASA Mission mission has discovered thousands of possible planets that orbit around other stars, which is that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures liberal intensity of stars when planets go ahead of them, and block a little bit of that light that gets us.
The data collected by Kepler shows the sizes of planets as well as the distance between them and their stem star.
In essence, this helps us understand whether these planets are small, records like the Earth's land planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their own.
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this training of potentially livable worlds -- our own planet is locked under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014, it was the most hot record.
Global and sea ice that has been with us from millennia, now they're disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on global scale have rapidly lifted our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, and I'm not astonishing.
But I study the religious report of the planet in the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say it looks for alien opportunities in the inner sector.
Now, as someone really interested in the search of life in the universe I can tell you that the more they look for planets similar to the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds invited a comparison between the planet recently discovered and the planets we know better, the ones in our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and rich, and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can consider a potentially livable world showing this by a mission like Kevin.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and partly that's why we study both Mars.
Our robots like "confidence, tracking its surface in pursuit of the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that orbit it, like the Malton mission, take samples from the Martian atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose his tangible.
private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these marine images remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the influences and plans and post-organized ideas compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the destructive areas of our planet that are still going to be connected, really elaborate places compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and higher places on Earth the air is fresh and oxygen full of oxygen by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by Mars colonization and other planets would be able to get a big and sad shadow, the implications and the belief of some of Mars that Mars would expect to save ourselves from this intangible self-assembly of the only planet that we know is truly habitatory, the Earth.
And so I like interview exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to save humanity is how to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party is going to have a place later in the boats saved later.   Thank you.
But the targets for interpersonal exploration and land preservation is not over.
No, they're actually faces of the same coin, the goal of understanding, preserving and improving life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world light as extraterrestrial landscape.
They just find it closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain habitable spaces, in the hostile areas and the massive areas of the Earth, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a mental experiment, the Fermi paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked me, realizing that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of alien life existence until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the Ferrency paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough technology to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of planets that push this development.
It's arrogant to think that only interpersonal colonies will save us from ourselves, but planetary preservation and international exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to join the hostile environments from Mars to the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the tangible on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I ran my own house.
And as I was in the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table, where I had left them.
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all well closed.
I thought about calling a closed, at least I had my cell phone, but to midnight, a closed could take a lot of time to come in, and I was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night, because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I was predicting my passport and my suitcase waste.
It turns out expensive, but I sure not more expensive than a close night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I went out of it.
I'm a professional professional and I know a little bit about how the brain is under stress.
The light collection is increasing the heart rhythm, the model of adrenaline and the newspaper levels.
And when I got to the factory show in the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to wonder, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in its place, that they help happen bad things.
Or at least, if bad things happen, that minimize the probability of it is a total catastrophe.
So I got to think about that, but even a month later, my thoughts didn't cross it.
I was dinner with my colleague Danny Karajada, who was won from the Nobel Prize, and a little bit embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called prosperity records.
It's something that he had learned from psychologist Gary Korea, who had written about this a few years before, known as the presence.
Everybody knows what the post-controlled is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what was going wrong, right?
On the presence, as Danny explained -- you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, next, trying to figure out what it can do to prevent things happen or to minimize damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a presence.
Some of them are evidence, others are not so obvious.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, I will describe a place for things that are easily lost.
This sounds like common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this thesis based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called the hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where the good things are, where the fish are, which are the fish and the friends of the fruit and enemies.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that goes into the London tapestries.
It's the part of the brain that allows authors to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the dark sense of the automobiles, and yet they could find their nuts.
They don't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason to lose keys of the car, reading goggles and passport.
So at home you take a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a decorative dish.
For his passport, a particular box.
For their reading glasses, a particular message in particular.
If you take a place and you are school with them your stuff will always be there when you look at them.
What about traps.
Take the cell phone, a picture of your credit cards, light light, passenger, sending them up to yourself so you're in the cloud.
If these things are lost or the robots, this can facilitate superman.
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain releases compassion.
The cortisol, the cortex is toxic.
So part of the practical practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems in your site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention or a loved being, to help us with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is raised as a game for all of all sorts of medical decisions and in fact for financial decision and social decisions and any kind of decision that you have to take from a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit."
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, attacks to the heart, demand brain.
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to prescribe a drug that will help you reduce the collaboration, a status?
And you may have heard about the states, and you know it's one of the most remarkable drugs in the world today. It's even likely to know people who take them.
So you think, "Yes, reminded the state?
But there's a question that you have to do then -- a statistic that is supposed to be asked that most doctors don't want to talk, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for NGO, the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the NGO.
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or join a surgery in any medical procedure before you help a person.
And should you think about what kind of statistics discovered is that?
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's no blame of the doctor, and if it's guilty of someone, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood the underlying mechanism.
But the Georgeton estimates that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number need to treat the most widely recently successful, what do you think is?
How many people have to take before they help a person?
300 percent.
This is about the research of cynical researchers Jerry Greek and Pamela Harvard, confident by Bible by Bible.
I explore the numbers.
300 people have to take drug for a year before we can avoid just a single heart attack, or a brain store or another event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 to go down my collapse.
Why not? Isn't it doctor?
But then you have to ask for a statistically, and it is, "The single effects of the side effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those things include terrible things, deposit muscle pain and articulate pain, but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking medicine.
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think of clarity.
So think about how to fill this over time, so you don't have to make the root chain in the act.
300 people take the drug -- right? A person has helped you, five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that you help your medicine.
I don't say they had or not take the status.
I just say you should have this conversation with your doctor.
Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have access to access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take your risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical to treatment.
For the surgery that most of the men are done in the older 50 of 50 percent, the number necessary to treat is 49.
This is, 49 surgeries for a person who has helped it.
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the impossible or extremism emerging, university incentive, recent ladies, fecal incentive.
And if you get lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just to take a year or two.
So the idea of prescription is to think about time the questions that you can plan to push the conversation forward.
You don't have to do all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have an option many times, you want a shorter life free from pain, or a longer life that could have a lot of pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases the under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a predator -- it's not necessary the digestive system, or the freedom or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react with rapidly. You could get to be the lunch of lions -- so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thinking, like Danny Karajan and his colleagues have demonstrated it.
So we have to train them to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all definitive.
We're all going to fail every once in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those fails, to put the systems in the place that will help us minimize damage, or to prevent that bad things happen in the first place.
Really reduced to the night of Michael in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor inspired me a little bit of a combination next to the door, with a point of the entrance door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters I haven't ordered and lots of email messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organization, but I see the organization as a gradual process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: Pie, "I'm my favorite musical symbols.
It means playing surface.
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a "button in the particular, you need to play more surrounding.
Two feet, even further.
Four years, extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a telephone tree, there you see it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of pounds can have never come to a complete silence.
That's my definition of silence, a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system system, the Island, besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs language came over the 1980s, and over the time of the time, it mixes with local signs and developed the language that we now know as Asia.
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born deaf, and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I now realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a deaf person living in a world of sound, it's like I live in a foreign country, following their rules, costs, behaviors and norms without questioning.
So how do I understand sound up?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my spinal and advanced sound.
I learned and copied that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people answer.
So I learned, for example.
"Don't accept the door?
"Don't do a lot of noise when you eat the bag of free pages?
"Not editors, and when you're eating -- you're not going to hold you up in the platform?
All of this is called sound "slide."
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super virtual superconductor.
And I'm always waiting with neuroscience the sound, which is about to come next.
So, this drawing.
TED, for deciding it.
TBP:
TB: So by announce 3D.
You can see that the fish has no notes on the lines.
That's because lines already contain sound through subtle normals and manifestations.
In the deaf culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for "The Tasmanian, in the Osland."
A typical fish has five lines.
But for me, I will do the self with my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings, I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic resident there.
Before this time, I had worked as a painting.
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the attention.
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
Is it going to get more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it a tactile way, or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound property and integrate it into my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and deliver it.
I began to create a new job body.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was impressed with the amount of support and attention I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, control, social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was oblivious -- it was something of a head person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could leave me and my artistic job, or I could empower me.
I chose to get involved with me.
There's a massive culture around the language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me from the same and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different performers from Asia.
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be listening.
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you ask your voices, I am able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could download on forget and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium, deep in the world of music.
And I was amazed by seeing the similarities between music and the Osland.
For example, a musical note cannot be captured and expressing in paper.
And the same thing can tell us from a concept in Oslanda.
The two are very spatial and highly modest things that mean that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the sounds of sound.
I would like to share with you a metaphor of the piano to understand how the USDA works.
So, imagine a piano.
The Union divided into many different gravitational parameters.
If you assign a different paradigm for each finger as you touch the piano, like facial expression, the body movement, the speed, the shape of hand and so on, as you touch the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you put it just at a time.
However, the Ash is more like a retrofut, you need the 10 fingers in a simultaneous way to express a clear concept or an idea in Asia.
If just a keyboard will change the radiation, create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with the music in terms of tone, fear and volume.
In Asia, by using these different graphics parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal "high in that."
This is the "naurual signal.
I'm looking at you.
Look at it.
Oh, I was carrying me.
Oh oh.
What are you looking for?
Oh, enough.
So I got to think, and if I see the Ash through the lenses of the music?
If I had to create a sign and repeat it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of "The sun, the sun comes out and puts.
This is "The day."
If you repeat it and reduce the speed, visually, it looks like a musical piece.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can tell me the night.
"All the night.
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of nights -- "Wow, "Do you get the night --  -- "I know the night?
I feel like the third has more musical than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in Asia, and how distance to the body can express changes over time.
For example, one is a hand, two hours, is two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is "The long time."
And then I said, "I will be a "Service, and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at a time, "And once.
"Mom common is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per company.
But when I see the word "simple common, I think automatically in "the same time."
You see MIT, right hand right hand. My left hand.
We have the penicilla through the head and the chest.
"And MIT, I guarantee flex. (Music Courts. My five from the floor, I'm going to show you a form of hand called "The Florida Flock."
Can you do it with me?
Everything with the hands in high.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as the chest, something like "simple common, or "The same time."
Yeah, very good.
That means "serious, in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help to communicate in all cultures and signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means "slipper, in the Osland.
Now, the third one. Please tell me again.
And again.
It's "belovet, in the Osland.
We're going to do the three together.
"The "beautiful, "slip, and "completely."
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest, but it creates very different meaning.
It's amazing to see how the United States is alive and prosperous as the music.
But today, we live in a very public world.
And only because the United States has no sounds, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to begin to question what the social value defines and allow us to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn Asia, not that you have to hear to learn music.
The Ash is a rich training and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience your visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
Dennis Karajada, Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents told me, "You know, they were announcing everything, but then you have to clean it."
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a block of innocence, or a bubble bubble I have to say, because adults lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults also engage and that they're not very good at cleaning other people's others.
The time happened, now I'm an adult and I teach citizens and invention at Harvard school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk through the tropical beach with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, we clean the beaches out, and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I didn't give it.
It's sad to say, but today more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of strangely.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big boats and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and we classify them, and we collect this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge boats.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream with inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this work of work with height as a story that children very rarely can be involved.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to the plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its fraction.
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to combine it into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just collecting information.
Through the use of a robot, we take an image of this plastic -- kids are very excited about robots.
And then we quickly created what we call "the prototype.
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended before to lunch.
And we will transform lights and web cameras in access and we assemble it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic slowly floating through the sensor while the onboard computer process this image and measuring the size of each particle to get an approximate estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
We document this invented step on a website for inventors called "the "beautiful, with the hope that someone gets better even more.
The great thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and child, they're trying to solve immediately.
I was researching my local problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well informed.
You see the news, the Internet confirm, and they played with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years -- clean a oil spill, just using the hands, in Subart, the largest mangrove forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water you drink, it's the water in which you be broken, the water where you fish the place where you live.
You can also see that water is brown -- the mud and the oil is also brown color, and when everything is mixed up, it's very hard to see what in the water.
But there's a simple technology called spectrum, which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a viewer that can accumulate through all kinds of substance that produce different spectrum, which can help identify what's in the water.
We tried this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students use their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I'm going to investigate a problem at the distance. I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it took several giant waves, called the tablets, and those tsunami destroyed several cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant of Furness, a nuclear center near the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has a context of pollution pollute?
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of Furnans everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has safe aspect -- it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to Furnithelines every year from the accident and research in a way independent with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take children.
Of course, we didn't take them, parents didn't allow them.
But every night we're reporting to the control center, here you see the use of different mask.
He might seem like they didn't take serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with radioactive their whole life.
Together with them we discuss the data that day, and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies -- and so on.
And to do this, we created a rules of rules of the region around the nuclear energy plant.
We created the elevation map, we introduced pictures to represent real-time data of radiation, and we collect water to simulate rain.
So with this, we could notice that radioactive powder is leaking from the top of the mountain to the wild system and descriptions in the ocean.
It was a classification estimate.
But based on this we organized a civil expedition, the closest to nuclear central to date.
We went up to 1.5 miles of nuclear central center, and with the aid of the area of the area we were collecting sea seats with a seat of sediment as we invented and built us.
Here's a progression here, we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem, to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a little bit, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and is a place where we can work with wood with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, of optical optics -- you can basically build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with adult aid, and where adults can be children again.
Students, acceleration, Acceleration.
Convention Harry, we asked things like, can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or can we help in the mobility of the advanced age population transforming their window chairs into new electrical vehicles.
The plastic, oil and radio are terrible legacy -- but the worst legacy we can leave our children are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent solutions.
So scientific citizens, creators -- software, we need to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two twin cells, two radically opposite cultures.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is about the environment, the other one believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michael angel said that when he looked at the miracle in brutal -- he saw a figure I struggled for being free.
The centimeter was unique Michael tools.
But living beings are not centralized.
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that was required by each cell to work and to replicate it.
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by rights of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have made a world made by parts of them, taking the imagination of designers and architects together to think about their objects as extractions of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find human material substitutions in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are dentisted with distraction portals.
The backs on the back are more thick with small panels.
You act primarily as a filter, the other mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same skin, there are no parts, no strikes.
It's a system that gradually vary its functionality through the variation variation.
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world, twice the pain personality of every designer and architecture to work currently between the center and the gene, between the machine and the gene, between the extraction and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and seats, is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions out of the world, taking away from the supercomputer and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they trust, four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools we never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I created.
Please know the minds and hands of my students.
We designed objects and products, structures and tools through scales -- of large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a 24 feet of diameter with a vibrating basis that no very distant day print entire buildings, and graphs to Nanopatch made of genetically modified microscopic marketing in darkness.
Here's the cancer, an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every single architect is only to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we were exploring the possibility of creating a layer and a failure. This was for a particular partner from Paris with Iran van Herob. It's like a second skin made from a single piece, rock in the contracts, flexible around the waist.
Together with 3D printing computer presentations, we printed this layer and failed 3D without costs between the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 microscope.
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a CD.
That designers have access to this high-tech, high-resolution analog and the synthetic instruments, allowing us to design products that are adapting not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues as well.
We've also designed an acoustic chair, a chair at the same time, complimentation and also absorb sound.
Professor Carter -- my collaborator went back to nature to inspire it, and by designing this intervention pattern pattern, it becomes a birth.
We print this subject of 44 different properties, which vary in rich, optimistic and color, correspond to pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not through the addition of another material or another substitute, but to continuously value the material property.
But is it the ideal nature?
Are there parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Hebrew Bible, and one of them came up to me and I got to define a lot of what I care about.
As she was relaxing, "In the third day of the creation, God sent the Earth to grow a fruit charge of fruit crime?
For that first fruit tree, there would be no difference between trunk, broken, leaves and fruit.
All the tree was a fruit.
Instead, land was growing trees with branches and cortex, stage and flowers.
The land created a world made by parts.
I often ask myself, "What would design be like if the objects were made from a single piece?
Let's go back to a better state of creation?
So we look for the biblical material, the kind of material of the fruit tree of fruit with fruit and we find it.
The second most abundant biomass on the planet is called salt, and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, schools and marine.
We thought that if we could synthesize their properties, we could generate multi-their structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal marine shark --  We asked a lot of charge husks -- we mold them and we produce strikes of burns.
Variable complicated consciousness, we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and opaque, to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures of scale, a system is built with multiple rounds of rural controlled control.
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from one material that was 3.5 meters long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry to find a natural shape in the contact with air.
So why do we keep designing plastics?
The air bubbles that were a supermarket of the printing process were used to contain photographers that came for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators in Harvard and MIT, we included the bacteria designed genetically to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of life to mesh -- and if you spread even more, to windows.
A free fruit tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best part, for objects designed for biodiversity, on the sea, feeding the marine life, and put it on the ground, help grow a tree.
The approach for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We were looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for interviewed travel.
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So as the periodic table, we made our own goal of elements -- new forms of life created business, artificial manufacturing and biological ways.
I like to think about synthetic biology like liquid alcoholita, only instead of making beautiful metals -- new biological worms within very small channels.
This field is called microbes.
We printed our own 3D channels to control the flow of these liquid bacterial crops.
In our first piece of clothing, they combine two microscopes.
The first is crucial one.
It lives in our oceans and the freshwater stars.
And the second one, E. Colombia, the bacteria that inhabit the human intestine.
One converts light in sugar, the other sugar consumption and produces useful biofuels.
But these two microorganisms, they don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never met.
They are here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but design evolution.
To keep these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the digestive device, which will help to flow these bacteria and to alter their function of path.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, and they will have the properties of material according to functional functionality.
If we wanted more photographs, we designed more transparent channels.
This sort of paralyzed digestive system, when you stretch from one end to another one -- about 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our thin intestine is.
And here it is, as a private at TED, our first portable photographers, brilliant liquid channels in the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary Shanghai said, "We are creative country creatures, only half is done?
What if design will provide the other middle?
What if we could create structures that increase living matter?
And if we could create personal microbes that scan our skin, they would repair the damaged tissue and reach our bodies away."
Think about this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
And so now, you know that a 3D printer prints material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do this.
I grew up with a software.
This capita of the worm -- for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home inside which is medication.
The manufacturing manufacturer is about this level of sophistication.
It does it by combination of two materials, but two proteins in different concentrations in different concentrations in different ways.
One act as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, using those fibers each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first comes up in the environment, creates a tension structure, and then starts hit a capita capita.
The tension and the compression. The two forces of life, they manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we put a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the spinal.
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the architecture complex of the silk worm.
However, when you put silk worm on a flat wall, not within a box, we realized that it has a flat capita and still metabolic it.
So we started designing different environments, different attacks, and we've discovered that the shape -- composition -- the stress structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often attach silk worms to death inside their chapters, their silk stressed down, and it's used in the textile industry.
We saw that designing these platforms we could shape the silly silk without having a single chapter.
It was medically striking, and we could create these things.
So we scale this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a frozen robot making silk platforms, and we put ourselves in our site.
We knew that silk worms migrated to more dark and more cold areas -- so we used a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or antibiotics, to block the rays of light and heat and distribute silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the origins.
We asked 6,000 worms of silk to a online silk farm online.
And after feeding four weeks, they were prepared to helium with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the attack, and as it was handle, they were about the password, they put eggs and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
The ice silk silk on the robust dry silk is giving all of this pavilion its integrity.
And in a bit more than two or three weeks, 6,000 pounds of silk took 6,000 kilometers.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
Polios, after the ethical, produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional pages in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A dry thread through a robotic arm, the other full floor.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers have to unite these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which led us from an inspired design in nature to an inspired nature in the design, which demands from us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked yourself, "What do you want to be a bigger?
If you had to remember what age you had when you first asked them for the first time this one?
You can show them with the fingers.
Three, five, three, five, five.
Now, raise your hand if you want to be a bigger."
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be a bigger?
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had too much.
In school, I liked English and the motors and the art and developed websites, and I also played the guitar on a gang named Telescope Franklin.
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to try and pursue it anyway, because I've spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this sense of traditional -- this feeling of, this is not a challenge, it's going to be engaged.
And I have to leave it.
But then I got interested in something else, which is totally different, and I'm going to be supporting it in it, and I let me absorb and I feel "I feel? I've found the morning, and then again this point where I start to get the back.
And finally, I want to leave it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to get into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to convert all this into a career.
I thought I had to pick up one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and resist me to be bored.
Another reason why I got so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me because I wouldn't define anything.
I was worried about having fear to compromise or to be disappeared, or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have to have put it out.
Ask themselves, where you learn to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where you would learn it, you learn it from culture.
We are asked first, "What do you want to be a bigger?
We have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares what we answered at that age.
It was considered an naive question to provide cute answers in children like, "I'm astronomy, or "I want to be parade?
They insert the disparity of Santa here.
So this question is done over and over again as we grow in different ways, and the way, to high school students are asked they're going to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be a bigger?
It's going to happen from being the cute exercise of before what sleep.
Why?
While this question inspired kids to dream what they might be, they don't inspire sleep with everything they could be.
In fact, it's just the opposite of it, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though you have a good adults and you can say, "Oh, what nice but you can't be a violent and psychology.
You have to choose?
This is Dr. Bob Chileses -- and he is a visual and psychological artist.
And this Am North And editor of magazine turned into illustration, business and teacher and critical director.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they're going to have to choose it.
But it's more than that.
The notion of living life is very ideological in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real voice, the idea that every one of us has something that we will do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who's connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling that there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a multi-third.
A multinational is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a ball of a share.
It could help if they divide in three parts, multiple and potential and days.
You can also use other terms that connect the same idea, as a frustration, reverse.
During the record of the Renaissance, the ideal was who was okay in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Share refers to us as "none "Candle?
It uses any term you like or invented your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adaptability to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the multi-third as a limitation or a approach that you should see.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be like this.
Here are three multi-their supercomputers.
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new at the intersection of it.
Now Hawaii and Rachel Bill would express their shared interests in cartoons, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design, by finding Mesopoten.
Media is a company that creates geographically inspired jewelry.
So and Rachel came up with this unique idea for her economic mistake of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And multiple, with all of their antibiotics, can access a lot of these interpretation points.
The second multinational superpower is fast learning.
When the multicellular is interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being principles, for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort areas.
A lot of skills are transferred to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we presented to, so we rarely start from zero.
Now Now Dong Dan is a full-time travel and writing independent time.
As an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest thing to know.
Before you become writer, North was financial planning.
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when he started their practices, and this ability helps him write a compelling launch.
It's rarely a waste of time going on to what you add to you, even if you finally abandon it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have anticipated.
The third multinational superpower is antibodies -- I mean, the ability to transform into anything you need in a given situation.
Abed Canada is sometimes a video director of videos, other websites, web pages -- sometimes conventional phone designers, sometimes teachers, and sometimes apparently, James Bonne.
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can be able to be able to take different roles depending on the needs of their clients.
The Fortune Martine Magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and interrupted that they are the individuals and organizations that can be able to be able to satisfy market needs, which really will thrive with.
So synthesis of ideas, rapid learning and adaptability -- three skills where multi-tacking are very high, and three skills that you could lose if they're ready to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest to foster the multi-thirds to themselves.
We have complex problems, multiplication right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in their heart, specialists.
They came out of the womb knowing because they wanted to be pediatric neuroscience.
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are composed of a specialist, and a multi-third multi-third.
The specialty can dive in depth and put in practice ideas, and the multinational offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to be around the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, multi-three-dimension multiple people are encouraged to simply be more like their specialized partners.
Once I said that, if there is one thing you take from this talk, I hope it is this: recognizing with the internal wire, whatever it is.
If you're a heart specialist, then, special for all media.
That's where you will give the best of you.
But for the multi-three-dimension in the room, including those who have just noticed to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I tell you, recognized with their many passions.
They follow their curiosity by those rabbit magnets.
You explore the concerns.
Open our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, multiplication, the world needs us.
Thank you.
In 1981, a woman called August to a psychiatrist in France.
It was deposited and couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called Alex.
Alec didn't know how to help Australia, but she was flying for her until that, unfortunately, passed in 1956.
After his death, Alex did a car and they found weird and underwater plates in the brain of Australia, a guy who had never seen before.
Even more surprising.
If Albert had been alive today, we couldn't give her more help than Alec gave him 112 years ago.
Alan was Dr. Alan Alzheimer's was.
And Automatic stopped, the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
Since 1903, medicine has advanced a lot.
They have been discovered by antibiotics and vaccines to protect them from infection, many treatments for cancer, antibiotics for HIV, states for the categories and much more.
But soon it has been progress in the treatment of Alzheimer's treatment.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
The Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But in 2050, they affect 150 million that, by the way, including many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is chance that they spend their years left with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or being loved with Alzheimer's.
Already in America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
It's the most expensive disease today, and its costs provide an increase of five times in 2050, as the baby generation gets older.
You may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest medical and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to fight it.
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's only is the only one that can't be preventing, cure or even repair its development.
We understand less about Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research than the Alzheimer's fact that costs us more the Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but everybody should, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can cure it.
For most of the last 11 years, everybody, even scientists, confused Alzheimer's with aging.
We think they will be signaling in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy aging brain in comparison with an Alzheimer's patient to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's dramatically reduces life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alexander found strangers and weird other ones in the brain of Australia a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in paper that are peripheral.
And when it folds right, these sticky dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some sticky dots stay in the outside.
This makes molecules of protein to stick each other, forming groups that can form big plates and other ones.
That's what we see in patients with Alzheimer's brain.
And we've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this discussion works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identities of what happens to block is complex, like defined a bomb.
Course a wire could do anything.
Charge others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that blocks it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have reduced the wires and waiting for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, genetics, chemicals, physicists, engineers and mathematics.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now, it's now testing a new type of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when I tried these drugs in worms in worms in worms of worms.
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, they have protein molecules that are painting between themselves, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that they come up and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result, but research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After 14 years of wait, there's real hope of what it can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to sell the Alzheimer's, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We should be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we try it, we can see it.
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have caught more research and executive pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and legislation.
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to sell cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved beings and night, are often too density to go out and advocate for change.
So, really depends on you.
Alzheimer's isn't in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like Power, which can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They help talk for them, and they help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York City column in New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, I do this.
The article about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience by testing myself a night from the past summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers will turn to ask 36 more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions from example.
Number 12, if you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or ability, what would it be?
Number 28 -- when was the last time you cried to another person?
And so ...
As they move forward, these are increasingly personal.
Number 30 -- I really love -- Tell your partner what you're glad about him or her, I know very well this time, and I gave things that I would not say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled with this study a few years ago, a detail really called me attention, the joke that two of the participants had been married six months later and invited all of the lab to ceremony.
So, I was skeptical about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also intrigued as well.
And when I had the idea of testing this study, someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect to fall in.
However, we love, and   And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the Column Mountain a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already angry, so I guess some of you probably ask, are you going to go together with you?
And the reason I think is questioning this is because they've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just about what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the article was published, it was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had told me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagine that my article in the New York Times will probably be a few thousand views.
And that was a good attention of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as he said, I had no idea.
The article published on a Friday at night, and the Saturday, this happened in my blog traffic.
And the Sunday, they had been called the Toronto Shakespeare and the Google Mould American More.
In a month, the article received over eight million visitors -- and I was to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with synchronization experiences, but another thing is to discover that the love life of one has been international news --  -- and people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called or writing, what they did every day for weeks, always did the same question: Do you still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email of my email with the phrase, "Where are you following together?
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewing the radio and asked it.
Even I gave a talk, and a woman wrote to the stage, "Hey Mandela is your night?
And I immediately put it red.
I understand this is part of it.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the recovery of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have been living in life.
In fact, the New York Times published a complementary article for San Valley, who included the experiences of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very reserved with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both made a public emergence together.
I reject television interviews, and you read the pictures of pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the informal icon of the energy process -- a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute capital.
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked, they wanted to know if it really worked. What if it was able to produce love lost, not just an adventure, but love real, love peripheral.
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months old, and I felt, especially that people ask the wrong question.
How do we know if we follow together or not, and also tell me?"
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 less interesting questions.
Dr. Arthur Arabic wrote first about these questions in 1997, and there, the research goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking at finding interpersonal anti-access between college students, using what Arabic called substantial and surveying and programmer and record.
Sounds romantic sounds rules, right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt more close after doing it. Several teams later were using the Air Protest protocol of Art as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between members of police and community, and they've used it between people of opposite political ideology.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, who combined personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and told me with limitation, I tried the study and didn't work.
He seemed to be destroyed by it.
And I mean, you want to fall in love with the person who did it?
Well, he made a pause for him.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I did. But they became better friends.
Did you feel that you would get better known after testing the study better?
The attack.
So, it worked. I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he looked for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled with the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation.
I had had that relationship since I was 20, which I knew practically my entire adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I flew in science.
I was researching everything I could find on romantic love, and I hoped that that could sort of grab the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I just thought about it for the book I wrote but in retrospect, it seems really obvious.
I thought if I walked with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad as I felt like that.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one other way.
I'm more patient. I'm more relevant.
I have more confidence in demanding what I look for.
But I can also see more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than what I reasonably can tell me to me.
What I'm looking for love is a guarantee -- not just being loved today and being loved tomorrow, but it will keep being loved by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there can be a shortcut to fall in.
There can be a way to somehow mitigate some of the implicit risk, and this is a very nice story, because it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The version of the story that I ask, still following together?
And his content with an answer of Yes or not.
So more than one question, I'll propose that we ask more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things are completely complicated and how do you know when to cut and distinguish?
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably makes a relationship, or even more, how do you live with your own partner?
I don't know necessarily answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more reflective conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's this one, a year ago and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we love, we still follow together, and I'm very happy.
But it's not the same thing to stay in love.
Forget is the easy part.
So at the end of my article wrote, love didn't happen.
We're going to stay in love because we took the choice to be.
And I shudder a little bit about reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the moment, I hadn't considered everything that chose that choice.
I didn't consider how many times we would have to make that decision, and how many times having to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, have chosen to love someone so generous and love and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest day in America.
But what I've done, instead, is to convert my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think about.
And what I look for, and what maybe my life is looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the very happy end of the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't write.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also loves me, and it's scary -- but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some mountain pickles leapers, and in a way, I came up with a forest grass.
I have a time ago.  Something that really affected me but more detail later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I buried a dollar bill -- a pen and a fork on it somewhere in Colorado somewhere.
And I thought some weird humans or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and learn how our species exchange ideas, for example how we eat the spaces.
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has funny because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was in Hawaii -- I like to go from excuse and surrounded and all those weird things, and I was doing a wire for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I gave him all the pages and I did a kind of color celebrators to the Agnes Arthur, the restaurant covers and a bee kept caught out.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees, and it's allergic to them, so I got more resistant to the canvas, thinking that I could hide it.
Instead, it happened the opposite, in some ways that it seemed like it goes out of size, as if you look at the text with a magnifying light.
So I did -- I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was going to find on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to relate and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow tracks, draw it as well as a box on the crime scene.
And I took the objects and created my own spectacular sperm hydrogen.
First, batteries, you can make an idea.
Then I did some strange insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw in the rescue layer.
And it was great, because I started riding exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to Silicon.
It was great, man.
At some point I was interested in the human shape, sculptural sculpture sculptures with human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing, died.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin, I was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass layers, similar to drawing in a window, then in another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that formed a three-dimensional composition.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the resin, right?
So I did this for years, and my work covered with something very big that I call "The "Commercial?
For the "Commandment, I was inspired by the back of the Department of Harvards Boston who is a painting at the Museum of Prote in Spain.
Do you know that?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
It's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the "Commandment, I'll explain this piece.
It weighs 11,000 pounds.
500 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the landscapes.
There's a cave where all these creatures with the heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They come from the world of representation to this analog mesh infrastructure where they hide.
This is where creatures with animals are headed on the side, ready to suicide mass in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a string.
Billy Graham is on the sea, the Houston -- the oil platform of the shark -- Wall Bin Laden's shelter -- there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of multicellular.
It's coming out of the ocean, and oil spit in a hand while the other hand comes out of it.
Their hands are like batteries and it seems like a military being that keeps Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a "brain aspect."
It's a little narrative a little bit.
That's the hand that I spit in.
And then when you go on the other side, it has a trip, like a bird of bird, and it spit clouds from this journey.
It also has a $100 long tail.
Anyway, their tail is founded by the way on a volcano.
I don't know why that happened.
Things that happen, you know.
His tail ended up in a clip ice clip made from terrorist cards in 1986.
Have you seen them?
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards.
It takes me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two projects. One is called "slipper."
This is a six-year-old project to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material being enemies, dictionaries or magazines.
But each act as a kind of archive in ways of being human, and traveling in groups of 20, four or 12.
They're like cells, they get together, they divide up.
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope of microscopes that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the head -- there's the chest, you can get the entrance in.
I will take you through the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover it or not, or whatever it does, a kind of analogous thing.
It's a quick narrative of these works because I can't explain it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in the middle half.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and enter the head of this strange statue here.
There is a little forest scene within the therapy quality.
Can you see it?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called Planto Worldches.
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a music, a male explosion, a museum, a school, an editorial arm that will spread all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We look at the box and all of the people inside each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you reduce who is and the box you're living in.
And together we realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made from the same matter and the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with dollar and genetically we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you get your head?
They take a hospital.
But so this pill has an effect against pain, first goes through the stomach, the insects and the other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective and industrial system so that any drug has come up in the body.
The disappearing, though, is that by bringing any drug out of medicine.
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take antiretroviral drugs that are going to be able to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the CO2 cells.
But they are also known by their adverse side effects, mostly negative -- because in the time that they take to reach the blood stream, they draw down, and worse than the time that they take to get to their fate, which is where it is more important, in the HIV warehouse.
These are the regions of the body like lymph nodes -- the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is introduced and it doesn't easily enter the blood tower of patients who are subjected to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after treatment of treatment, virus can wake up and infect new blood cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with today's drugs that is a treatment of life for the order of a brand.
One day, I felt and I thought, "Can we get the treatment directly to the view of the virus, without the risk of school school?
As a scientific expert in lasers -- the answer was in front of me, the legs, of course.
If you use it in objective, for the care care and surgery, you can use it for anything imagine, including the intricate transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using laser pulses to open or lose extremely small holes that open and close almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best thing is, "How is that possible?
We sent a little bit and powerful laser on the cellular membrane infected by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs drugs in a matter of microscopes.
Before you even realize the hole is immediately represented.
We're currently testing this technology in vitro or in Petri plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"What is that possible? You can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a three head device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make an investment at the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is headed to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head -- an insect that distributes the drug, it releases it directly on the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem much about time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all the research of HIV in our case, a treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying a state of armed armed groups, no state organizations like terrorists or institutions or military.
document what these groups do when they're not shooting up.
My goal is to understand better to these agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to nonviolent control.
I do a field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost every conflict in course, because war has changed.
I used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, from the 21 peace arrangements between 1975.
So we need to understand these groups, we should even be involved or defending them in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons they fight, how they do, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't fight.
The armed struggle and the politicians are related.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less defending, without global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the Head Hello, known for his violent face against Israel.
From his creation in the 1980s, Helly has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Happy Pauling was known by his suicide attacks against Israel, also managing the Gaza de Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just shooting up.
They're multiplication.
It sets up a complex machine of communication, radio stations, TV channels, Internet sites and strategies in social networks.
And here have the USA magazine printed in English and published to recruit it.
Armanda groups also invest in a complex funding of funds, but by business businesses, for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
armed groups are also doing something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, additional hospitals, put in a professional training program or microbes.
Hello offers all these services and more.
Armanda groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state not free, safety and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan displayed the war or even the beginning of the DNA ascent -- can also understand the efforts of these groups for safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has an incredibly elevated price for the population.
But in general, social services provide social services means to fill a vacuum, a gap left by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 of Hales cannot understand without acknowledging the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage, even in the West, when we look at the armed groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid hydrogen.
They grow up because they fill down the government, and they come up as armed groups and political groups, engaging in violent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated these organizations, less we can adjust it as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like Hellop] ...
They dominated part of a territory, they manage all of their functions, they collect the trash system, they manage the allegiant system.
Is it a state. Is it a reduction group?
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is Islam?
The lines describe.
We live in a world of states, of nations with no state and hydrogen and the more weak the states, like the Middle East today, more integrated and fill that gap.
This is important for governments because to counter these groups to have to invest more in no military tools.
They fill that governance gap has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand the armed groups, we understand better what incentives offer to foster the transition of violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- the military power can win some battles, but it will not give us peace or stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that governance gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist one.
My opinions about gender equality are vehicles, but I fear that they will open up openly the label of "the "magic, it would be unfair for feminists.
I'm a feminist but pretty bad.
And therefore I was self-interestingly as a bad feminist bad.
Or, at least, I wrote an article and a book called "The Bala famous, and then in interviews, people started to call the Maltese Factories.
So what started as a personal joke defined myself and a deliberate profession, has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step behind.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about the feminist feminists, these high women, angry with men and they hated sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the people in the instant that could be feminist.
Being tagged as feminist was an accusation.
I was labeled as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which I ask too much, with high self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman reduction, until you realize that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I began to accept that I am, in fact, feminist and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are irrelevant, women are equal to men.
We deserve the same supply for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as we want, free or violence.
We have right to use easy and accessible to the anti-based and services and reproductive services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need of legislative control or electrical documents.
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs, you have to have our other identity.
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and sexuality condition, social condition, skills and much more.
We have to have these differences and how we affect ourselves in the same way that what we have in common.
Without this kind of entropy, our feminist is nothing.
For me, these truths are evidence, but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist of me.
I have another conference.
When I drive the work, I hear music rap to all volume.
Although the letter depressed women and made me profoundly made -- the classic "The Shakespeare of the Yeans yang is amazing.
"I reality with your flat card.
Excuse me, do you get the container down?
Think about it.
pure poetry, right?
I'm completely upset by my musical taste.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, including --  all the domestic tasks -- but also killing insects, the trash capture, the care care and the maintenance of manufacturing.
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
They enjoy fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The Barrier, and the romantic comedy comedy, and I have absurd fantasies of the stories of people who make it happen.
Some of my drugs are more disappeared.
If a woman wants to adopt the loss of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to judge it.
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, he accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is our society is confident so that the women are economically vulnerable when they choose to.
We solve this problem.
Recognized the conventional feminist that has ignored or defined historically the needs of the color women, the workers, the homosexual and transparency, to favor of white women, hypertension, middle class and high class.
You know, if that's good feminist -- I'm a very bad feminist family.
The next thing: As a feminist -- I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put farmers in a period.
We hope that they went to perfection.
When we get decomporados, we took them very much from the same periodic party where we put them.
As I said, I'm a disaster -- I already consider that period before you try to get there.
Too many women, particularly innovators and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being labeled as feminist.
They have fear to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm feminist, for fear of what that tag means for fear to not be able to deal with the little expectations.
Let's take for example to Benjamin, or like I call it. The God.
In the last years it's a decorating feminist family.
In the Video Museum attack of 2014, in Malted, in front of the word "slip, three feet tall.
It was a magnificent show, looking at this star of the pop burning openly the feminist and making women know and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
I spent the time, cultural critics started internal debates if Beethoven was or not exactly feminist.
They captured their feminist instead of simply believing the word of an adult and mature woman.
We demand perception of the feminist -- because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so carefully a lot.
We go far beyond the creative and constructive critic to design the feminist of any woman, defending it until it doesn't know.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminist or rather, a more inclusive feminist is the point of party.
But what happens next?
We were going to go to recognize our imperatives to realize count, go to action and be a little bit more valuable.
If I hear degraded music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more than happy to provide an unlimited supply.
These artists don't change their way of talking about women in their songs until we express change effectively affecting their profit.
It certainly is hard.
Why does its music have to be so pregnant?
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my nieces from three and four years.
These are two magnificent girls, decisions and brilliant and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
They are appreciated by the strong creatures that they are.
I think about them, suddenly, the best choice is visible as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sports -- it goes the Troub of Trones.
We can change radio emissions when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than decorative objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes treat their peers, like boats.
In any case, men, especially white men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, you participate in your project, or to work with you, until you don't include an enough number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your publication or your organization is more inclusive with a wider range of people?
Those of us who are supportive but invited to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also deny to be included until we are welcome to overcome the barriers to the decision-making jobs.
We are not just perfectly personally. Without these efforts, without adopt these positions.
We can make these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to get to the top, people in the direct power and the producers of film and music and music, Li, legislators -- people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim our feminist -- well, bad, or any group.
The last line of my book "Marcus Fisheral says, "I'm going to be a bad feminist to not be at all.
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, especially because I got my voice out of my voice, and the feminist helped me to recover.
There was an incident.
I call it income to address what happened.
A few kids got me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was anything.
I started to believe it wasn't anything.
They stole my voice, and after all, I don't dare to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And with it I was writing.
I laugh in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing and the feminist, I also discovered that if I was a little bad, another woman could hear and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the humiliating reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little bit brave. When you need a value.
Right after Christmas last year, 133 children in California had survival for having visited Disorders or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, infects over 100 children in Congo.
One of the tragic things of this outbreak is that the measles, which can be fatal for a child with a dense immune system, is one of the most easily preventable diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century, but many of the kids involved in the Disney outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposedly worse, the autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that went into the politics about autism and vaccines and disabled and marked by being a dragonian fraud by the British Medical Journal Gramma.
Isn't most intelligent scientists that the theory that vaccines cause autism is a statistics?
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still afraid that vaccines put in danger to their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatrician that I've heard had heard about it created their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, prevalence estimates were stabilized by just three or four children per 10,000 children per 100,000.
But then, in the 1970s, the numbers started shooting away.
The funding organizations of funding such as Australia School is referred to routine the autism as an epidemic as if I could tell you from another child in Disorder.
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Center of Disease Disease Center what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like "making diagnosis "slips, and "A best detection of cases to explain these growing figures.
But that kind of language is not a way of disabled the fears of a young mother who seeks in the face of his two year-old son -- visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to expand them, why were they so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the 1970s.
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than the slow and carbon progress of science than with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what the autism is and how they discovered, but that story turned out to be false and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate story in the autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo Kanzi, at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in 1933, Canada published an article that described 11 young patients that seemed to be a private world to be able to be able to have the people around them, even to their own parents.
They could have fun for hours to shake their hands before their faces, but they were pressure of the panic for minority as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
Over the basis of patients treated in their clinic, Kanzi speculated that autism is very rare.
By the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as far as South Africa.
This is actually not extraordinary, because the Barrier criteria for autism diagnosis were very resistant.
For example, they dismiss to give that diagnosis to children with conventions, but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
And he once realized that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to their office for being autistic without giving them an autism.
Kanzi was an intelligent man, but part of his theories were not centers.
I classify autism as a form of child psychology caused by cold and destruction.
These kids, he said, have been held carefully in a refrigerator.
At the same time, however, Kanzi noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that will attack in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 minutes before it was two years ago.
When her mother put one of his favorite records he said, "I was stuck.
But Banglade had a bad opinion of these skills, and they would claim things like kids were simply replacing what they had heard their parents asked them, desperate for winning their approach.
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, that researchers started testing the bacterial theory that autism was weird.
Robert World, cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of the net mothers in Kanzi was pretty stupid.
She and his husband John were warm and affordable people, and they had a profound autistic daughter called Sun.
Korea and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like Sweden without support services, without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service, they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, Korea and their colleague, Judith Gore decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
They fought a London suburbs called Cambridge to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the Kansa model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more colorful and diverse.
Some children could not talk at all, while others were imprisoned in their fascination for astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genetics of reality.
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in beautiful and substantial squares as Julia, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the Mandarin model of Kanzi would have predicted.
At first, they were losing for trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one have been left from these children before?
But then Rosetta found a reference to an article published in German in 1944, the next year to the Bala article -- and then he forgot it, buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
Kanzi knew about this article of competition, but he chose to mention him in his own work.
There was not even a translation to English, but luckily, the husband of Korea spoke German, and he translated it for her.
The document offers an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man named Hans Askahren, who ran an integrated clinic with an inner school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
And the ideas of Asperger's to teach children with learning differences were progressive even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and kids followed their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Apple described it as a political disability of life that require compassionate forms of support and adult spaces during the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Apple called them their little teachers, and they are dedicated to help the development of education methods that were especially right to them.
And fundamentally Apple saw autism as a confidence that was continued to be a staggering variety of money and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common, and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in a known clay in the pop culture as social scientist and destructive social scientist.
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, an autism pizza is essential.
Lord and Julian discovered that Kanzi was wrong in that autism was infectious, as well as parents were the causals.
In the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of Psychiatry to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that would reflect the diversity of what they called autonomous "participant."
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes came into live, replacing the limited model of Kanzi by a broad and even Apple include.
These changes don't fall in a broken savage.
Carried, when Lou and Julius worked between based on barriers to reform these criteria -- people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I was "Step Man" in 1988, just a small circle, I knew for experts I knew what the autism, but after the innovative innovation of Duran Howard as Ray Babylon, and the recognition of "The Man Actoria, perfection, psychologists, teachers and fathers all over the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
She didn't have a connection to that little experts of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of "The Man Man, the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created an effect of network, a perfect storm of autism awareness.
The number of diagnoses started to embrace, just like Pragusal and Julian -- actually hoped that it would be, to get people with autism and their families finally got the support and the services that were dependent.
So Andrew Washington came to blame the vaccines by the increase in the diagnostics -- a simple, powerful and self-interest history as bad as the theory of Kanzi that autism was infected.
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one in 60 children in America are in the spectrum -- it's right, the autism is one of the largest minority groups in the world.
Over the last few years, autistic people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new medical advances in the term of the terminal terms, to celebrate the variety of human cognition.
One way to understand neuroscience is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Williams, it doesn't mean it's broken.
According to the autistic standards, the normal human brain is easily distraction, social obsessional -- and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
Indeed, autistic people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching Apple, which thinks that the "collapse, for the most advanced aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employees with capacity, support communities, and parents in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named Zowart Zoober once said, "We have all the hands in cover for the boat of humanity.
As we navigate towards an uncertain future, we need all forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
